"In the Washington of 2016, even when the policy can be bipartisan, the politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U. S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures ”appropriate” but also ”overdue” and ”a prime example of this administration’s ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.” Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. ”[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia’s worldwide aggression, including its   operations,” wrote Rep. Devin Nunes,  . chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ”Now with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted.” Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks,  . called for ”much tougher” actions and said three times that Obama had ”finally found his tongue.” Meanwhile, at    and on Fox News, various spokesmen for   Trump said Obama’s real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. They spoke of Obama trying to ”tie Trump’s hands” or ”box him in,” meaning the   would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country’s embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged   city of Aleppo that fell to Assad’s forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to ”find” missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U. S. levels of support for NATO  —   Putin’s longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump’s extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain,  . and Lindsay Graham,  . C. prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U. S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions  —   the idea that they helped Trump win  —   has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump’s legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr,  . C. to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U. S. intelligence agencies’ concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U. S. intelligence reports to date and suggested ”no one really knows what happened.” He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to ”get on with our lives and do more important things.” However, at week’s end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The   has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn) with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil  —   the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia’s hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U. S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U. S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister’s recommended package of    responses. (He even sent an invitation for U. S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be ”the bigger man,” even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: ”Great move on delay (by V. Putin)   I always knew he was very smart!” At the moment it may seem that the overall Russia question amounts to the first crisis facing the Trump presidency. Whether forced by this campaign interference issue or not, Trump must grasp the nettle of a relationship Mitt Romney once called the greatest threat to U. S. security in the world. To be sure, Trump needs to dispel doubts about his ability to stand up to Putin, who has bullied and cajoled his way to center stage in recent world affairs. But Trump also seems determined to turn the page on past U. S. commitments, from free trade philosophy to funding of NATO and the United Nations. And if his Twitter account is any guide, Trump shows little concern about the conundrum others perceive to be facing him. Above all, Trump has shown himself determined to play by his own rules. A year ago, many were confident that would not work for him in the world of presidential politics. We are about to find out whether it works for him in the Oval Office."
"  Donald Trump has used Twitter  —   his preferred means of communication  —   to weigh in on a swath of foreign policy issues over the past few weeks. His comments give a glimpse into how his incoming administration will deal with pressing foreign matters  —   but also highlight how reactionary comments on social media can immediately spur international concern and attention. And his staff has indicated that taking to Twitter to air his concerns or, often, grievances, won’t end once he enters the Oval Office. On Wednesday, Trump blasted the U. S.’s abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. The tweets came just hours before Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech defending the decision and calling the continued building of settlements on Palestinian territory in the West Bank a threat to the   solution in the region. Trump’s support for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  —   who has had a fraught relationship with President Obama  —   may be the biggest forthcoming shift in immediate foreign policy between the outgoing and incoming administrations. Throughout the campaign, he pledged that his administration would be a steadfast ally of Israel. To underscore that, Netanyahu replied to one of Trump’s morning tweets, thanking him  —   and also his children Donald Jr. and Ivanka, who are close advisers  —   for their support. Ivanka converted to Judaism when she married her husband, Jared Kushner. An Israeli official told CNN the government will give the Trump administration ”detailed, sensitive information” proving that the U. S. worked to push through the resolution. The Obama administration has denied those claims. Last week, after the U. S. decided not to veto the resolution, Trump also tweeted that ”things will be different” come his inauguration, and then on Monday he again blasted the U. N. as ineffective. The Israeli settlement issue has been at the forefront in recent days, but last week Trump also weighed in on nuclear issues. In a tweet, Trump called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal. MSNBC’s Morning Joe reported that the   told them he wanted an ”arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass.” As the Washington Post’s Dan Zak told NPR’s Robert Siegel on All Things Considered last Friday, Trump was inconsistent in his statements about nuclear weapons during the campaign. ”Trump said, you know, he’d be the last to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are a horror. He seemed to understand what they’re capable of doing,” Zak said. ”At the same time, he said it was only a matter of time until countries like South Korea and Japan get nuclear weapons. He seemed to tacitly or not so tacitly endorse proliferation, again going against decades of international policy.” Trump also slammed China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, calling it ”unpresidented” in a tweet before correcting the typo in a new tweet. After talks with the Pentagon, China agreed to return the drone, but then Trump later said the country should keep it. It’s not the first time Trump has stoked tensions with China. In a stark break with protocol, Trump spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai   earlier this month. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a renegade province and doesn’t recognize it, and most other countries don’t either. The U. S. has operated under a ”one China” policy for more than four decades. Throughout the campaign, Trump blasted China for taking away U. S. jobs and claimed it was intentionally devaluing its currency to boost exports. He has blasted U. S. companies that manufacture goods in China, but as a New York Times story noted Wednesday morning, many of his daughter Ivanka’s clothing and shoe lines are made in China much of Trump’s own apparel line is also made overseas, including in China."
"  Donald Trump is unabashedly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after outgoing President Obama issued tough sanctions against the country in response to alleged cyberattacks intended to influence the U. S. elections. In a tweet Friday afternoon, Trump responded to Putin’s decision not to expel U. S. diplomats from Russia in kind after Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country  —   admiring the Russian leader’s strategic approach over President Obama, which is the theme of Trump’s ongoing praise of Putin. Earlier Friday, Putin instead signaled he would wait to decide how to move forward until Trump takes office, giving him someone in the Oval Office who has been much friendlier and quite generous with his praise  —   a stark break from decades of U. S. foreign policy. The Russian Embassy in the U. S. also retweeted Trump’s post, which he pinned to his Twitter timeline so it would remain at the top. Trump also posted it to Instagram. On Thursday, President Obama issued a stinging rebuke to Russia after U. S. intelligence officials concluded the country had directed hacks into Democratic National Committee emails and the personal email account of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. In a statement, Obama said ”all Americans should be alarmed by Russia’s actions.” Trump’s praise of Putin stands in stark contrast not just with the outgoing administration, but with top leaders of his own party. GOP congressional leaders backed Obama’s actions on Thursday, albeit criticizing the president for being too late in taking a strong stance against Russia. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions ”overdue” but ”appropriate” and said that ”Russia does not share America’s interests.” ”The Russians are not our friends,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, calling the sanctions a ”good initial step.” Obama has pointed to the impact of past sanctions by the U. S. and Europe in the wake of the annexation of Crimea, maintaining that his approach has damaged Russia’s economy and isolated the country on the world stage. Trump released a brief statement Thursday evening in response to the latest actions by Obama against Russia simply stating that, ”It’s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things.” He said he would meet with U. S. intelligence officials regarding the cyberhacking, though Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on their findings and throughout the campaign dismissed reports that Russia was behind the attacks. Trump raised eyebrows throughout the campaign with his praise of Putin. ”He’s running his country, and at least he’s a leader, unlike what we have in this country,” Trump said in an interview with MSNBC in December 2015. He was pressed by host Joe Scarborough on the killings of political figures and journalists critical of Putin and deflected. That interview came just after Putin praised Trump as ”talented.” Later in the campaign, Trump suggested Russia should find emails missing from Hillary Clinton’s time as secretary of state, which his aides later said was a joke. At the time, Trump tried distancing himself from Putin. ”I never met Putin. I don’t know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I’m a genius. I said, ’Thank you very much’ to the newspaper, and that was the end of it,” Trump said. But not long after, Trump was heavily criticized for saying Putin wasn’t going into Ukraine, even though his country had already annexed Crimea. The Republican nominee also repeated his praise of Putin as ”a leader far more than our president has been” at a national security town hall in early September. One of the most memorable clashes in Trump’s debates with Hillary Clinton was when the Democratic nominee accused him of being a ”puppet” of Russia. Trump shot back: ”No puppet. No puppet. You’re the puppet.” He often criticizes the   ”reset” with Russia that Clinton led in the early days of the Obama administration, even as Trump himself repeatedly has called for friendlier relations with Moscow. With three weeks until Inauguration Day, Trump has increasingly used his Twitter feed to weigh in on foreign policy  —   violating usual protocols where the winner of an election avoids interfering in the foreign policy actions of the sitting president. Trump’s staff has said such use of Twitter to weigh in on foreign policy won’t end once he’s in the Oval Office. So far, he’s outlined his opposition to the United States’ abstention from the U. N. Security Council vote on Israeli settlements earlier this month. Trump has also criticized China for its seizure of an unmanned U. S. Navy underwater drone, before saying the country that he’s often criticized should keep the drone. And Trump has also called for the U. S. to strengthen its nuclear arsenal and recently seemed to encourage a nuclear arms race with Russia  —   perhaps because he believes his strategic approach to Putin will work better than Obama’s."
"Updated at 2:50 p. m. ET, Russian President Vladimir Putin says Russia won’t be expelling U. S. diplomats in a    response to U. S. sanctions, as his foreign minister had suggested earlier Friday. Instead, he says he will decide how to move forward depending on the actions of   Donald Trump’s administration. Trump took to Twitter on Friday afternoon to praise Putin’s decision, calling it a ”great move.” On Thursday, the White House announced sanctions against Russia in response to what it called ”a   campaign of   operations” against the U. S.  —   including actions meant to interfere with the U. S. presidential election. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went on state TV and called the sanctions ”antics” that Russia can’t leave unanswered. He said the U. S. provided no evidence for its claims of Russian cyber operations, NPR’s Lucian Kim reports. ”The Kremlin has consistently denied accusations that its hackers had broken into the Democratic National Committee or tried to sway the U. S. election,” Lucian notes. And he proposed specific counteractions Russia could take. As we reported Thursday, President Obama’s executive order calls for 35 Russian diplomats  —   described by the White House as ”intelligence operatives”  —   to be expelled from the U. S. and for two Russian facilities in the U. S. to be closed. Sanctions will also be imposed on several Russian individuals and organizations, and Obama’s statement says more actions will be taken, ”some of which will not be publicized.” Lavrov announced plans for Russia to respond in kind, as Lucian reported from Moscow. Lavrov’s plan, which needed Putin’s approval, called for 35 American diplomats to be expelled and for U. S. diplomats to ”lose access to two buildings, just as Russian diplomats will no longer be able to use two retreats in Maryland and New York,” Lucian reports. But just two hours after Lavrov’s comments, Putin announced that nothing of the sort was happening. Putin called the Obama administration’s actions provocative and said Russia had grounds for a response. He said the Kremlin would reserve the right to a countermeasure  —   but that it would not ”stoop to the level of irresponsible diplomacy,” as Lucian translated it. At least for now, no diplomats will be expelled or barred from using facilities in Moscow, he said. Any actions will wait until Trump takes office. ”It is regrettable that the Obama administration is ending its term in this manner,” Putin said. ”Nevertheless, I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family. ”My season’s greetings also to   Donald Trump and the American people. I wish all of you happiness and prosperity.”"

Donald Trump has not released his tax returns, so the best clues about his privately held business interests come from a financial disclosure form he released in May. ”The document covers scores of pages with small type, and suggests he is financially involved with hundreds of companies, including some that simply license his name. ”A dive into that disclosure form, submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, shows his largest sources of revenue are golf courses and   rents.

And the problems they face can tie into major problems found in schools: chronic absence, low achievement, disruptive behavior and dropping out. ”Experts say schools could play a role in identifying students with problems and helping them succeed.

And yet Americans were once urged to sweeten it with salt. ”Ad campaigns from the first and second world wars tried to convince us that ’Grapefruit Tastes Sweeter With Salt!’ as one 1946 ad for Morton’s in Life magazine put it. The pairing, these ads swore, enhanced the flavor. ”In our   world, these curious culinary time capsules raise the question: Does salt really make grapefruit taste sweeter? And if this practice was once common, why do few people seem to eat grapefruit this way today?” Rio de Janeiro hosted the world’s elite athletes in an Olympics that promised transcendent moments in sports  —   and potential controversies outside of the competition. The Summer Games began Aug. 5, and more than 10, 000 athletes from 206 countries participated. From concerns over the Zika virus and Russian athletes banned on doping charges to incredible wins by the U.

From there, he descended into a seemingly endless cycle of traffic stops, fines, court appearances, late fees, revocations and reinstatements in various jurisdictions. ”Court records raise big questions: Was Castile targeted by police?

More than 11, 000 have arrived in the U. S. this year, fulfilling a pledge by the Obama administration.

"I did not want to join yoga class. I hated those   beatific instructors. I worried that the people in the class could fold up like origami and I’d fold up like a bread stick. I understood the need for stretchy clothes but not for total anatomical disclosure. But my hip joints hurt and so did my shoulders, and my upper back hurt even more than my lower back and my brain would. not. shut. up. I asked my doctor about medication and he said he didn’t like the side effects and was pretty sure I wouldn’t, either. So I signed up for Gentle Mind and Body Yoga, the   of yoga classes. I think the principle is that you get into some pose that has cosmic implications and then hold the pose until you are enlightened or bored silly. I like the bridge pose, where you lie flat on your back and put a rubber block under your butt. I purely hate the eagle pose, where you wind your arms around each other and then wrap your legs around each other and stand on one foot I drop like a sprayed mosquito. The teacher is forgiving: ”Yogi’s choice,” she says, meaning that I’m now a yogi and I can do what I want. She says we’re not trying to get anywhere, and I deeply appreciate not trying to get anywhere. I enjoy a stretchy pose where you sit with a knee crossed over a leg and the opposite arm wrapped around the knee but the point is, says the teacher, to wring the toxins out of your internal organs. I’m not going to wring out my internal organs. Sometimes she wants us to lower our shoulders and raise our chests to open up our hearts  —   a phrase that gives me   creeps. The best is the sponge or corpse pose, which is what it sounds like. I’m fully competent at being a sponge, except you’re supposed to breathe in all the way up your left side and breathe out on your right because this activates your left and right brains. I just breathe on both sides. Then we sit on some     blankets that smell like unwashed humanity, with legs crossed. The teacher says this is called sukhasana which means easy seat, but it’s no such thing. So I stretch my legs out in front of me, yogi’s choice. We end in sukhasana with our hands in prayer and say to each other namaste, which is apparently Sanskrit for the godhead in me salutes the godhead in you, but which my brain hears as basta, which is Italian for stop it, enough. I’m OK with all this, even the pretend science which I’m free to ignore or better yet, to subject to my fellow Last Word on Nothing blogger Michelle Nijhuis’ stellar B******* Prevention Protocol (BPP) which in these days of blatant disinformation if you haven’t read, clipped out and taped to your computer screen, you may as well join an ant colony. Some b. s. you don’t need a protocol to detect, so I didn’t even try to find out whether twisting my body wrings the toxins out of my internal organs or whether breathing through my left nostril stimulates my right brain. But it’s true that after yoga, climbing steps doesn’t hurt, waiting for Greek carryout promised 15 minutes ago isn’t irritating, and on the drive home my brain doesn’t do anything except drive. Does yoga work? I’d answer this, but working through the full BPP takes time. So I took three shortcuts. One, I searched for yoga and efficacy in PubMed, the database of the National Library of Medicine, and skimmed the titles of review articles. No answer, or rather, too many answers: yoga for cancer, chronic low back pain, diabetes, cystitis, sleep disorders, hypertension, schizophrenia, depression, multiple sclerosis. And that was just on the first page. The second shortcut was no better. I searched the website of the National Academies Press, which publishes independent scientific analyses for the government. Yoga showed up in studies on pain management, alternative medicine, improving bus operators’ health and teens’ sleep habits, obesity, fitness, Gulf War syndrome, astronaut care and PTSD. The third shortcut was the Cochrane Reviews, independent reviews of medical information: same thing  —   yoga for asthma, cardiovascular disease, epilepsy. Bill Broad has probably answered all these questions in his book The Science of Yoga, but I’m not going to read it. My rule for any one thing that affects so many different diseases and functions is that it affects none of them and completely fails the BPP. Or else it affects something huge and general like mood or immune function that in turn affects everything else. What with lots of kinds of yogas, lots of different diseases, lots of different kinds of studies and    entities like mood or immune function, I’m giving up. I haven’t a clue whether yoga helps at all, let alone how. You’re on your own here. For myself, I’ll keep going, not because it’s not b. s. but because I like occasionally painless stairs and quiet brains. Besides, I’m finally getting competent at the infant version of the sun salute and I’ve learned never to look at the other people in the class. But I have no plans to advance to Beginning Yoga.

"With a   who has publicly supported the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, suggested that climate change is a hoax dreamed up by the Chinese, and appointed to his Cabinet a retired neurosurgeon who doesn’t buy the theory of evolution, things might look grim for science. Yet watching Patti Smith sing ”A Hard Rain’s   Fall” live streamed from the Nobel Prize ceremony in early December to a room full of physicists, chemists and physicians  —   watching her twice choke up, each time stopping the song altogether, only to push on through all seven wordy minutes of one of Bob Dylan’s most beloved songs  —   left me optimistic. Taking nothing away from the very real anxieties about future funding and support for science, neuroscience in particular has had plenty of promising leads that could help fulfill Alfred Nobel’s mission to better humanity. In the spirit of optimism, and with input from the Society for Neuroscience, here are a few of the noteworthy neuroscientific achievements of 2016. One of the more fascinating fields of neuroscience of late entails mapping the crosstalk between our biomes, brains and immune systems. In July, a group from the University of Virginia published a study in Nature showing that the immune system, in addition to protecting us from a daily barrage of potentially infectious microbes, can also influence social behavior. The researchers had previously shown that a type of white blood cells called T cells influence learning behavior in mice by communicating with the brain. Now they’ve shown that blocking T cell access to the brain influences rodent social preferences. It appears that interferon, an immune system factor released from T cells, is at least partly responsible for the findings. A single injection of interferon into the mice’s cerebrospinal fluid, the clear, protective fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord, was enough to restore social behaviors. Lead author Jonathan Kipnis from the University of Virginia speculates that there might be an evolutionary linkage here  —   one protecting us from the increased pathogen exposure that comes with socializing. He also says the findings could help improve our understanding and treatment of brain disorders. Of course these findings were in rodents, but earlier work by Kipnis suggests that the brain and immune system communicate in similar ways in humans. Major advances were also made this year in joining human with machine. In October 2015, Hanneke de Bruijne, a    Dutch woman with Lou Gehrig’s disease, received a brain implant that would allow her to communicate simply by thinking. Eighty percent of patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as the condition is also known, ultimately have trouble communicating because of muscle paralysis. At its extreme, this paralysis results in a tragic state called   syndrome, in which patients remain fully aware but can’t express themselves they become locked inside their own bodies. The new therapy, which comes on the heels of similar work out of East Tennessee State University, was developed by a team from the University Medical Center Utrecht in collaboration with Medtronic. It consists of four electrodes implanted over the motor region of the brain that connect to a wireless transmitter implanted in the chest. After 28 weeks of training, the device was able to recognize brain activity patterns that occur with thinking about typing a particular letter. Though de Bruijne’s muscles still can’t move, this   interface can now translate her brain waves  —   or her ”thoughts”  —   into text. Among the biggest neuroscience drug advances of the year was the Food and Drug Administration’s Dec. 23 approval of Biogen’s Spinraza, or nusinersen, the first treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. Spinal muscular atrophy is the No. 1 genetic cause of death in infants. Those affected by the devastating disorder carry a gene mutation that renders them unable to produce a protein essential to survival of neurons in the spinal cord. Gradually stripped of their abilities to walk, eat and breathe, most children struck with the disease don’t make it past 2 years old. Spinraza is a gene therapy that boosts the production of the essential protein. Despite possible side effects, which include bleeding complications, kidney toxicity and infection, the drug appears to work so well that two recent clinical trials were stopped early, as it was deemed unethical to withhold treatment from babies assigned to placebo groups. As with many other drugs for rare diseases, the price of Spinraza is expected to be high to help recoup research costs  —   perhaps as high as $250, 000 per year. The Alzheimer’s disease community also received welcome news this year. After hundreds of failed trials of potential treatments over the past couple of decades, the experimental drug aducanumab, also produced by Biogen, was found in early trials to slow the cognitive decline that comes with Alzheimer’s. And then there was the ongoing resurgence of psychedelic medicine. It’s been pretty well established that the hallucinogenic anesthetic ketamine may be an effective antidepressant. Now we have some potentially groundbreaking findings for psilocybin, the active compound in ”magic mushrooms.” Two clinical trials found that just a single high dose of the drug is effective at treating symptoms of both depression and anxiety in    patients. Scientists are unsure just how psilocybin works to relieve mental duress. But one theory holds that it disrupts   thought and fixation  —   common in those suffering from depression  —   allowing selfless cognition and experience to occur. In both trials the intensity of the patients’ ”mystical experiences” correlated with the decrease in symptoms. Both research groups strongly caution against recreational use or   with magic mushrooms, but the findings have many experts and institutions reconsidering the   of negative counterculture stigma surrounding psilocybin. The list of neuroscientific advances from the past 12 months goes on: The Human Connectome Project gave us the most complete map of the cerebral cortex to date a Canadian group revealed in part how fear memories are formed scientists at Mount Sinai charted the neurocircuitry behind social aggression. Still, the field of neuroscience remains, at best, in adolescence. As British novelist Matt Haig wrote in The Telegraph in 2015, ”Neuroscience is a baby science. . .. We know more about the moons of Jupiter than what is inside of our skulls.” As the year’s abundant advances attest, there is plenty of room left for discoveries in the coming year and beyond  —   and plenty of creative, eager researchers to make them.

"I was standing by the airport exit, debating whether to get a snack, when a young man with a round face approached me. I focused hard to decipher his words. In a thick accent, he asked me to help him find his suitcase. As we walked to baggage claim, I learned his name: Edward Murinzi. This was his very first plane trip. A refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, he’d just arrived to begin his American life. Beside the luggage carousel at Washington’s Reagan Airport, he looked out at the two lanes of traffic and the concrete wall beyond. ”So this is America?” he said. From finding his bag to finding his apartment and finding a job, there was a lot for Edward to learn. Later, he acknowledged that while he was standing in the airport looking for his luggage, he felt the magnitude of the task before him. He says questions were zipping around his head: ”How will I start? You get scared. How will I manage?” After he found his bag and I called his caseworker to come and pick him up, we parted ways. He thanked me for being his ”Airport Teacher.” But, it seemed to me, he needed a teacher for the rest of America. That might as well be Claire Mukundente’s job description  —   not in Edward’s case but for many other refugees. Halfway across the country, in Chicago, Mukundente works for the   Association, a   nonprofit, and spends her days visiting new refugees and helping them adapt to a new country. How Does The Stove Work? Today, she’s headed into a   apartment building on the city’s north side. On the second floor, Alexia Mukambalaga and six of her family members share a   apartment. They arrived two weeks ago from Congo  —   by way of Rwanda and Niger. The family crowds around a folding table for lunch  —   some standing, others sitting. Within minutes of meeting them, they ask Mukundente why the food in America tastes like pineapples. It’s so sweet, they tell her. Mukundente says food is always one of the first lessons: How to get it, how to cook it and what’s healthy. She helps the family figure out what goes in the freezer and fridge, and how to use a stove. Mukundente says many Congolese have spent more than a decade in refugee camps, so a lot of the stuff in a kitchen is brand new to them. Grocery stores, too. ”Shopping can be a big deal, especially for your own food,” says Claire Mukundente. She often accompanies new arrivals to the grocery store, explaining how to evaluate dozens of different cereal brands and why it’s important to avoid the sugary drinks. Then she moves on to other lessons: the banking system and bus routes, social norms and gender dynamics. Mukundente says they talk about ”almost everything.” She says these families have learned a lot shuttling between countries and refugee camps, but when they come to a place like Chicago, many of those skills don’t translate. But Mukundente insists that she’s not their teacher. Instead she says, ”I see them as myself. Like me, when I came.” Claire Mukundente fled Rwanda in the 1990s during the genocide. And after traveling through seven countries, she arrived in Chicago. She cleaned hotel rooms, tried to learn English and scrambled to find daycare for her three kids. Ten years ago, she decided to start teaching other refugees what she’d learned. But not all refugees have someone like Claire Mukundente. Three months after I met Edward at the airport, I visited his   apartment. It was about 30 minutes outside Washington, and he shared it with several other refugees. (He has since moved to Louisville, Ky.) Sitting in the living room that doubled as his bedroom, he told me that soon after arriving he realized he needed to be his own teacher. So, he started observing everything. ”I tried to observe very silently,” he said in the room that functions as his living room, bedroom, kitchen and dining room. He learned to read a map and a bank statement. But Edward says there was more he called them ”invisible lessons  —   ideas.” The biggest one? ”Time was paramount to every success in America.” Edward said that, during his 20 years in a refugee camp in Uganda, time had never before been linked to money. Just being a person meant you got a food ration, he said. But here, he got a job  —   as a line worker  —   and he was paid hourly. ”Time was important. Important!” He told me that things have been hard during his first three months  —   America hadn’t quite been the Promised Land he expected. ”I remember the story in the Bible: The Exodus.” Back in the refugee camp, Edward said, he always thought life would be easy in America, akin to the Biblical land of milk and honey. But now, he finds himself having to remember that the Israelites struggled, as refugees and newcomers. Eventually though, they learned to adapt to life in a new land. Edward says he hopes he will too."
"If movies were trying to be more realistic, perhaps the way to summon Batman shouldn’t have been the    —   it should have been the bat squeak. New research from the Bat Lab for   at Tel Aviv University found that bats are ”vocalizing” more information than many researchers previously thought. And researchers were able to decipher what the bats were squeaking to each other about  —   often they were bickering over things like food, sleep and mating. ”It’s not as if now we can understand everything. It’s not as if we have a    dictionary,” says Dr. Yossi Yovel, a   at Tel Aviv University and a member of the Bat Lab. ”But what we’ve found is that this cacophony that you could hear . .. actually contains much more information than previously believed. So, all of [this] shouting, all of these vocalizations that were previously all categorized as aggressive vocalizations, we can now divide them,” Yovel tells NPR’s Scott Simon. ”For example, we can classify whether the bats are arguing over food or over mating or over sleeping position or over other contexts,” he says. ”We can recognize the individuals vocalizing and we can even, to some extent, say who they are vocalizing to.” In a recent study, Yovel, along with researchers Yosef Prat and Mor Taub, monitored groups of Egyptian fruit bats with   audio and video recording for two and a half months. They say they analyzed almost 15, 000 bat vocalizations. Egyptian fruit bats are one of a small number of animal species to communicate    within their species, instead of ”broadcasting” their message. Bats do more than argue, Yovel says. But Egyptian fruit bats spend a lot of time arguing. ”Nearly all of the communication calls of the Egyptian fruit bat in the roost are emitted during aggressive pairwise interactions, involving squabbling over food or perching locations and protesting against mating attempts,” the researchers write. ”What they’re saying is stuff like: Why did you wake me up? Get out of my way,” Yovel says. ”In the case of mating, it’s usually the female protesting against a male who is trying to mate with her.” Context in bat communication was one focus of the study. If we humans say the word ”apple,” we imagine certain characteristics just from that word alone: a red color, a round shape, a certain taste, Yovel explains. ”This is something that is [a] very very important factor in human communication.” He says animals almost never demonstrate this ability. But their research shows that vocalizations between bats have more of this type of context than researchers knew about before. One goal of the research on bats is to apply it toward general knowledge of how different animals  —   including humans  —   communicate. ”It’s all part of a big question: How complex is animal communication?” Yovel says. ”Identifying context specific calls can be a first step toward the recovering of meaning in animal communication,” the researchers write. ”Understanding the encapsulated information in animal vocalizations is central to the study of sociality, communication, and language evolution.” So is there a   translator in the works? ”Step by step we are getting closer to deciphering their communication,” Yovel says. ”I don’t think we will  —   not in my time, at least  —   be able to really talk with them.”"
"Eighteen years ago, on New Year’s Eve, David Fisher visited an old farm in western Massachusetts, near the small town of Conway. No one was farming there at the time, and that’s what had drawn Fisher to the place. He was scouting for farmland. ”I remember walking out [to the fallow fields] at some point,” Fisher recalls. ”And in the moonlight  —   it was all snowy  —   it was like a blank canvas.” On that blank canvas, Fisher’s mind painted a picture of what could be there alongside the South River. He could see horses tilling the land  —   no tractors, no big machinery  —   and vegetable fields, and children running around. This is David Fisher’s American Dream. It may not be the conventional American Dream of upward economic mobility. But dreams like his have a long tradition in this country. Think of the Puritans and the Shakers and the Amish. These American dreams are the uncompromising pursuit of a difficult ideal. The scene that David Fisher imagined, on the New Year’s Eve almost two decades ago, has turned into reality. It’s called Natural Roots Farm. To get to the farm, you have to leave the motorized world behind. Cross the South River on a swinging footbridge, and there in front of you are seven acres of growing vegetables, neatly laid out in rows. It’s early in the fall, on this day the hillside beyond the fields is glowing with red and yellow leaves. It’s idyllic, almost magical. Anna Maclay is out checking on the fields. ”I came originally as an apprentice in 2002,” she tells me. ”Totally fell in love with the land. I just thought, ’I want to live here!” Her wish came true in a way she hadn’t expected. She and David Fisher fell in love and got married. They now have two   children: Leora and Gabriel. It’s a harvest day on the farm and David and Anna have some help. They’re joined by Emmet Van Driesche, who lives nearby on his own farm, and two apprentices, Kyle Farr and Calixta Killander, who are living and working on the farm for a year. Together, they’ll need to fill a wagon with spinach, beets, broccoli and a host of other vegetables and herbs. About two hundred customers have bought shares in the farm’s harvest. Among them is Maggie Potter. She arrives with her children to pick up her produce. ”It’s not only having the vegetables  —   the nourishment for our own bodies. It’s creating community, making friends along the way,” she says. If this all sounds like a vision of peace and contentment, take a closer look. Watch David Fisher at work. While the apprentices stick together in the fields, chatting as they work, Fisher works by himself, cutting greens off just above the soil, hacking out heads of broccoli. He moves quickly, with purpose in every step, almost never stopping, from daybreak until dusk. And when you talk with him, it becomes even clearer: He’s a very driven man. He’s driven, in fact, by a kind of desperation. And to understand it, you need to know his life story. David Fisher grew up in the suburbs north of New York City, in the village of Pleasantville, in Westchester County. He spent summers at a rustic camp in the Adirondacks. ”You could only get there by boat, you couldn’t drive there,” Fisher says. ”No electricity, bathe in the lake, live all summer in a tent.” Then, at the end of every summer, he’d get on a train back to Grand Central Station and it would hit him. ”Noise, steel and concrete and lights everywhere,” he recalls. It was an overwhelming sensory experience, and for young David, it wasn’t a pleasant one. When he was 15, that    paradigm shift was more than he could take. He was overtaken by despair over the environmental fate of the earth. ”I was like   this is craziness. The whole thing. Civilization as I’m seeing it is absurd. The way that humans are living on, consuming, destroying the earth is absurd,” he says. ”The only thing I could see to do was pack up and flee.” He determined to drop out of high school his parents forced him to get a diploma, graduating early. Then, Fisher got as far as he possibly could from houses and highways and smokestacks. He hung out in the west, skiing and backpacking, immersing himself in nature to ”soothe his soul,” as he puts it. He loved it, but he still knew, in the back of his mind, that it was just an escape. It wasn’t an enduring path out of his despair about the world. One day, when Fisher was 20 years old, he was back on the East Coast, visiting a friend at Hampshire College, here in western Massachusetts, and he wandered into the college’s small organic farm. It was another overwhelming sensory experience, but the opposite of Grand Central Station: ”Autumn leaves raining down, and the lush fields of vegetables and cover crops. Open the barn door, and the tables are lined with this abundance of earthy, healthy, vital produce. And I was like, ’Wow! ’” He felt like he was seeing, for the first time, a way to live immersed in the natural world, and also be productive. To make a living. He started learning to farm, from other farmers. And then he found this land near the town of Conway. You can call this farm utopian, if utopia is the kind of place where you work extra hard and live very frugally so that you can grow food in a way that’s more in harmony with nature. For instance: Half of the land on this farm is always devoted to ”cover crops” that don’t produce any food that customers will buy. The purpose of these crops is simply to protect and nourish the soil. His most defining choice, though, is to rely on horses as the primary source of power on the farm. Two of them, Pat and Lady, pull a wagon full of vegetables from the fields across the river and up a hill to a small barn beside the road where families come to pick up their produce. Kyle Farr, one of the apprentices, holds the reins and directs the horses with cryptic words and sucking sounds. David Fisher is committed to horses partly because it makes the farm more  . ”It’s so direct,” he says. He doesn’t have to rely on fossil fuels. ”The fuel is there in the grass. The power is right there, in the form of these live animals.” Also, he says, horses force you to work at a more natural rhythm. But there’s a cost, in the form of time. Horses need care and feeding every day, whether they’re pulling a wagon that day or not. Fisher learned this past year that two former apprentices at Natural Roots Farm who had learned to work with horses here and then adopted this method on their own farms, recently went back to farming with tractors. It bothers him. But he’s not giving up. Because for him, working with horses is one small answer to the despair that led him here. ”The environmental crisis is heavy. It’s a heavy, heavy situation. And to find any hope of effecting some sort of change, or examples [of change] is critical to my emotional, psychological ” he says. Over breakfast that day, I ask David, ”Are you a perfectionist?” He starts to deny it, but Anna cuts in. ”Yes!” she says. He and Anna both tell me that David’s driving ambition to build a better farm  —   constantly working, always starting some new project  —   has led to conflict between them. ”This is the   disagreement,” Anna says softly. ”I always think that we need to take on less, you know?” They’ve managed to keep this farm afloat for almost two decades now, but ”it’s still a serious struggle to make the economics of it work out,” David says. And apart from worries about money, they have to manage the logistics of a complicated life  —   200 families depending on a steady supply of produce from their farm, children in school and playing soccer, and their car parked on the other side of the river, a   walk from their rustic home. ”There’s not a lot that’s easy about living this way,” she says. ”But most of it feels pretty right. And I guess that’s turned out to be more important, for me.” Those are the words they often use, talking about their choices. This small, alternative American Dream, for them, just feels right."
"For years now, some of the best, wildest, most moving or revealing stories we’ve been telling ourselves have come not from books, movies or TV, but from video games. So we’re running an occasional series, Reading The Game, in which we take a look at some of these games from a literary perspective. I played the game through the first time in something like a perfect state of awe and terror. Enraptured is, I think, the word that best describes it. Carried away completely into this ruined, beautiful world and the story of Joel and Ellie in The Last of Us. Normally such a completionist  —   so obsessed with exploring every hide and hollow in these imaginary worlds I throw myself into  —   in this instance I simply rolled with the narrative. Ran when running was proper. Slogged through dark and rain and snow and sunshine. Stood my bloody ground when left with no other options. Joel came to love Ellie, his surrogate daughter, and Ellie came to love Joel, the only father she’d ever known. And I (a father, with a daughter roughly Ellie’s age, with Ellie’s   vocabulary and Ellie’s strange, discordant humor) loved Ellie, too. So when I reached the endgame and was presented with a terrible choice (no spoilers . .. yet) I drew my guns and slaughtered my way to the end credits, alight with fury and sure knowledge that I’d made the only choice I could. Second run: The beats are all the same, the story a known thing. Joel and Ellie fight zombies and soldiers and bandits and madmen. They lose friends and see sunrises and, this time, I play with an awful wisdom. Cassandra’s curse. I know how this story ends and I have made up my mind that, this time, I will make the other choice. The right one (morally, mathematically, humanistically) and so I walk with ghosts the whole way, right up to the end, and then . .. And then I make the exact same choice again. I can’t make the other. It hurts too much. Because that is how good the storytelling is in The Last Of Us. It makes you care so deeply for a   bunch of pixels in the shape of a teenage girl that you will damn the whole world twice just for her. (OK, so now we’re gonna get spoilery. Fair warning.) The Last Of Us is a zombie story. It is incredibly derivative, borrows liberally from a hundred different books and movies, is structurally simplistic,   melodramatic, viscerally violent, and despite all this (or, arguably, because of all this) tells one of the most moving, affecting and satisfying stories you’ll find anywhere. At its heart, it is the story of Joel  —   a broken and   thief and smuggler living 20 years deep into a zombie apocalypse. He and his partner, Tess, are forced into a job that requires them to smuggle a young girl out of the Boston quarantine zone and deliver her to an army of revolutionaries because, of course, this girl is The One  —   the only person ever to be immune to the   that turns infected people into gross, murderous mushroom zombies. That young girl is Ellie. And, unsurprisingly, the job does not exactly go as planned. If this all sounds familiar, that’s fine because it is familiar. The   is a stock frame  —   tested and dependable. It is a road trip story in the same way that Cormac McCarthy’s The Road is, or Mad Max: Fury Road. Go from point A to point B, survive the journey, get there whole. And there’s nothing at all wrong with a simple narrative architecture when it is being used to support complex character arcs, as it is here. The Last Of Us is a simple road trip story underneath, existing in service to the complex and rich redemption story on top. All the stakes and ruination are laid out in the first 10 minutes, in a prologue so powerful that it’ll break your heart even if you don’t have one. Joel loses his daughter on the night the world ends, his little girl dying in his arms, under the gun of a panicked soldier trying to hold back the infected. When Ellie floats into his life two decades later, the jaded gamer in you says, Oh, so here’s where he learns to love again. . .. And you’re right. But then you watch it happen  —   in tiny moments like when Ellie, blowing off caution, walks a rickety plank between two buildings and Joel glances briefly down at the watch he wears, a gift from his daughter that he’s been wearing for 20 years  —   and you participate in it happening (protecting her, defending her, eventually becoming her for an extended chunk of the game in a brilliant bit of perspective switching) and it all just clicks. This is a love story  —   one of the best    narratives ever told. Which is when that ending comes and you are presented with the ultimate parental nightmare scenario: Will you sacrifice the life of your child to save the world? Not a stranger, a friend or even a spouse, but your own daughter (which is what Ellie is now  —   Joel’s daughter, blood or no). Because in Ellie lives the cure to the mushroom zombie plague. But in order to create it, she has to die. I started a third playthrough before writing this piece. I am walking slow, taking my time, listening to Ellie read from her joke book, watching her swarmed by fireflies on the outskirts of Boston and admiring the natural beauty and deep environmental storytelling of the game. Nature has reclaimed most of this abandoned world, giving us an unusual apocalypse run riot with wildflowers. And while I have not made it to the end yet, I know it’s coming. I know the choice I’m going to have to make. And I know exactly what I’m going to do. Jason Sheehan is an   a former restaurant critic and the current food editor of Philadelphia magazine.

"For years now, some of the best, wildest, most moving or revealing stories we’ve been telling ourselves have come not from books, movies or TV, but from video games. So we’re starting an occasional series, Reading The Game, in which we take a look at some of these games from a literary perspective. In the beginning, I breathed only methane. Seeded onto a pinkish and poisoned world of scouring winds, I stumbled from my broken spaceship, unsure of my footing or anything else. I saw strange plants moving, the stalagmite spikes of ore deposits like plutonium fangs, the wreckage of my crash, dust. When I moved, I heard nothing but the crunch of my heavy boots and the occasional chime from my spacesuit  —   followed, always, by the weirdly autotuned computer voice in my ear saying, ”Environmental protection falling . ..” And hers was the only human voice left to speak in the whole of this impossible universe. And I was hooked. No Man’s Sky (released in its original form in August of 2016 by indie studio Hello Games, and updated just a couple weeks ago) is a bauble, an amazement that borders on magical in its opening hours, becomes almost hypnotically comfortable at a certain point, then simply majestic in its scope and incomprehensible size. It is, at its most elemental, a procedurally generated universe in a box  —   one containing 18 quintillion planets, all unique, all created, sculpted and populated by nothing more than random numbers and some math. Because of this hugeness, it is a lonely game. Land on a planet and it is yours alone. Land on ten, twenty, a hundred, and you will likely never see anything more than the traces left behind by other amateur spacemen who came this way before you. But the loneliness is part of the point of it. It is a game created to make you feel small in the face of the (nearly) infinite. So as I play, I do so in a universe empty of man. Or at least so close to empty that the difference between truth and the fiction I am building in my head is statistically null. No Man’s Sky comes in at polar ends of a long narrative spectrum. On the one side, there’s the   story of the game, which is just terrible. At worst, it is incomprehensible   gibberish about ancient civilizations and lost artifacts. And at it’s best, it ain’t much better  —   failing on many basic levels to tell a   about the   universe being a simulation (which, you know, it is) where the player (also called ”the Traveler”) is tasked by its creator to explore his way to the center of everything, essentially making the player a kind of   landlord checking in on all the tenants. But on the other hand, it is also the best game I have ever experienced for   storytelling. To crack the hissing cockpit of my spaceship and peek out through the trees of an alien forest, to run from robots or watch herds of galloping slugs running across the plains of a   desert  —   these are experiences made for children of the Dark Ages who gobbled pulp   like candy and lay back on cold hills, staring up into the   sky and dreaming of what was out there for   geeks who’ve never wanted for anything so much as they have for a spaceship, a jetpack, a ray gun and unlimited horizons. The only human in the universe, I played in a silence that was nearly complete, and loved No Man’s Sky precisely for its emptiness and for the way that even the few aliens I ran into spoke no language I knew. Granted, this changes. You learn words. You upgrade your stuff. If you’re me, you ignore the skeleton construct of the game’s story and simply roam. With the new update, I was suddenly granted the ability to build bases, to run freighters between stars, but that almost felt like work and I just shrugged and ignored most of it for the joys of simply romping around the ’verse, telling myself stories that were better than anything that lived within the construct of the game’s narrative. I could spend days hunting for just the right beach, the right view, or playing alien zoologist, meticulously cataloguing the   space dinosaurs on one world, then scare myself half to death by stumbling upon sea monsters at the bottom of a shallow, purple sea, jump into my ship, blast off, run from some pirates, and be bounding through the snows of an ice planet ten minutes later. The quest for the center of the universe, for the   of No Man’s Sky’s story, was far less interesting than the small, quiet, private stories that lived over every hill and horizon on every new world I discovered. No Man’s Sky does not tell a great story, but it contains multitudes of them. And any time it begins to grow dull or rote or predictable, all I have to do is look up, into the starry sky, and wonder what else might be out there. And then go find out for myself.

"The Colorado River is like a giant bank account for seven different states. Now it’s running short. For decades, the river has fed growing cities from Denver to Los Angeles. A lot of the produce in supermarkets across the country was grown with Colorado River water. But with climate change, and severe drought, the river is reaching a crisis point, and communities at each end of it are reacting very differently. Just outside Boulder, Colo. surrounded by an evergreen forest, is Gross Reservoir. Beverly Kurtz and Tim Guenthner live just out of eyesight from the giant   dam. And that’s on purpose. ”I could have built a house that overlooked the reservoir,” Kurtz says. But, she says, ”It’s choking off a wild river, which in my opinion is never a good thing.” Kurtz and Guenthner have a newfound job in retirement: fighting a proposed expansion to Gross Reservoir’s dam. The utility that owns it, Denver Water, wants to raise the concrete dam 131 feet. ”It doesn’t make any sense to build a   dam and disrupt the environment here when down the line, that’s not going to solve the problem,” Kurtz says. The problem is that Colorado’s population will nearly double by 2050. Future residents will need more water. Denver Water CEO Jim Lochhead says more storage is part of the solution. It’s also an insurance policy against future drought. ”From Denver Water’s perspective, if we can’t provide clean, reliable, sustainable water 100 years from now to our customers, we’re not doing our job,” Lochhead says. Demand for Colorado River water is already stretched thin. So it may sound crazy that places like Colorado and Wyoming want to develop more water projects. Legally, that’s something they are entitled to do. Wyoming is studying whether to store more water from a Colorado River tributary. ”We feel we have some room to grow, but we understand that growth comes with risk,” says Pat Tyrrell, who oversees Wyoming’s water rights. Risk because in 10 or 20 years there may not be enough water to fill up expanded reservoirs. A   drought has dramatically decreased water supply even as demand keeps growing. And climate change could make this picture worse. It makes Tyrrell’s job feel impossible. ”You understand the reality today of a low water supply,” he says. ”You also know that you’re going to have permit applications coming in to develop more water. What do you do?” Tyrrell says that as long as water is available, Wyoming will very likely keep finding new ways to store it. But a future with less water is coming. In California, that future of cutbacks has already arrived. The water that started in Colorado flows more than 1, 000 miles to greater Los Angeles. So even in the sixth year of California’s drought, some lawns are still green. ”Slowly but surely, the entire supply on Colorado River has become less reliable,” says Jeffrey Kightlinger, who manages the Metropolitan Water District in Southern California. He notes that the water level in Lake Mead, the biggest reservoir on the river, has been plummeting. An official shortage could be declared next winter. ”And that’ll be a historic moment,” Kightlinger says. It’s never happened before. Arizona and Nevada would be forced to cut back on how much water they draw from the river. California would be spared that fate, because it has senior water rights. So you wouldn’t expect to hear what Kightlinger says next. ”We are having voluntary discussions with Arizona and Nevada about what we would do proactively to help,” he says. California could help by giving up water before it has to, between 5 percent and 8 percent of its supply. Kightlinger isn’t offering this out of the goodness of his heart if Lake Mead drops too low, the federal government could step in and reallocate all the water, including California’s. ”We all realize if we model the future and we build in climate change, we could be in a world of hurt if we do nothing,” Kightlinger says. This idea of cooperation is somewhat revolutionary after years of lawsuits and bad blood. Recently, farmer Steve Benson was checking on one of his alfalfa fields near the Mexican border. ”We know there’s a target on our back in the Imperial Valley for the amount of water we use,” he says. This valley produces   of the country’s vegetables in the winter  —   with water from the Colorado River. In fact, for decades, California used more than its legal share of the river and had to cut back in 2003. This area, the Imperial Irrigation District, took the painful step of transferring some of its water to cities like San Diego. Bruce Kuhn voted on that water transfer as a board member of the district. ”It was the single hardest decision I have ever made in my life,” he says. Kuhn ended up casting the deciding vote to share water, which meant some farmers have had to fallow their land. ”It cost me some friends,” he says. ”I mean, we still talk but it isn’t the same.” Soon, Kuhn may have to make another painful decision about whether California should give up water to Arizona and Nevada. With an emergency shortage looming, Kuhn may have no choice. Grace Hood is a reporter with Colorado Public Radio. Lauren Sommer reports for KQED."
"For the last installment of NPR’s holiday recipe series, NPR founding mother Susan Stamberg lays out her special New Year’s Eve recipe for caviar pie. Here it is, so you can make it yourself. 6   egges, chopped3 tbs mayonnaise1 cup red onion, minced   cream   cup sour cream, Mix the eggs with the mayonnaise. Spread on bottom of oiled   spring pan or pie pan. Sprinkle with the minced onion. Soften with the cream cheese. Blend the mixture with the sour cream until smooth. Spread over minced onion with wet spatula. (Smooth it out with your fingers.) Cover with wax paper. Chill three hours or overnight. To serve: Spread and cover top with black caviar. Knife around sides of pan. Lift off the spring belt or just cut into wedges and lift out with pie knife. Serve with lemon slices and good crackers. I like eating it with a fork, like pie. Others spread it on crackers. Makes about 10 servings."
"Being overweight can raise your blood pressure, cholesterol and risk for developing diabetes. It could be bad for your brain, too. A diet high in saturated fats and sugars, the   Western diet, actually affects the parts of the brain that are important to memory and make people more likely to crave the unhealthful food, says psychologist Terry Davidson, director of the Center for Behavioral Neuroscience at American University in Washington, D. C. He didn’t start out studying what people ate. Instead, he was interested in learning more about the hippocampus, a part of the brain that’s heavily involved in memory. He was trying to figure out which parts of the hippocampus do what. He did that by studying rats that had very specific types of hippocampal damage and seeing what happened to them. In the process, Davidson noticed something strange. The rats with the hippocampal damage would go to pick up food more often than the other rats, but they would eat a little bit, then drop it. Davidson realized these rats didn’t know they were full. He says something similar may happen in human brains when people eat a diet high in fat and sugar. Davidson says there’s a vicious cycle of bad diets and brain changes. He points to a 2015 study in the Journal of Pediatrics that found obese children performed more poorly on memory tasks that test the hippocampus compared with kids who weren’t overweight. He says if our brain system is impaired by that kind of diet, ”that makes it more difficult for us to stop eating that diet. . .. I think the evidence is fairly substantial that you have an effect of these diets and obesity on brain function and cognitive function.” The evidence is growing. Research from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience published in July found that obese people have less white matter in their brains than their lean peers  —   as if their brains were 10 years older. A more recent study from researchers at the University of Arizona supports one of the leading theories, that high body mass is linked to inflammation, which affects the brain. But if we understand how obesity affects the brain and memory, then maybe we could use that relationship to prevent people from becoming obese in the first place. Lucy Cheke, a psychologist at the University of Cambridge, says her study in The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology this November gives her some idea of how to do that. Her researchers asked obese and lean people to do a memory task that’s a virtual treasure hunt. The subjects had to hide something in a scene across various computer sessions, then they were asked what they hid, where they hid it and in which session. The obese people were 15 to 20 percent worse than lean ones in all aspects of the experiment. The finding confirmed what other researchers had already seen in rodents. ”This really picks apart spatial, item and temporal memory, as well as, crucially, the ability to integrate them,” which Cheke says is ”one of the most fundamental aspects of memory.” If you’re obese, she says, you might just be ”10 to 15 to 20 percent more likely to not quite remember where you put your keys.” Diet isn’t necessarily destiny. People can compensate. As American University’s Davidson puts it, ”Let’s say I had a kid and I gave him a   diet and he showed hippocampal dysfunction. That kid may not do worse in school.” But, Davidson adds, the processes that help the kid do well in school may be impaired. When that happens, the kid would have to work harder and be more motivated and would ”have a tougher go of it.” Cheke says with the link between obesity and the brain growing as a field of research, we could see more ways of targeting obesity. For example, if the issue is that the diet of obese people degrades their memory and makes them more likely to overeat, then maybe making their meals more memorable would help them eat less of the bad stuff. Cheke says there’s already some research showing that if you watch TV while you eat lunch, you’ll eat more and also be more likely to get hungry in the afternoon and later to eat more at dinner. She says not watching TV while you eat is one of the ”small easy changes that people can make that don’t involve a lot of   and that don’t involve a lot of sacrifices, but that can still make a significant difference into how much you’re eating.” However, even though we are beginning to understand that obesity affects the brain, we don’t exactly know how, says John Gunstad, professor and director of the Applied Psychology Center at Kent State University in Ohio. He points out that obesity changes a lot about the body: blood sugar levels, the cardiovascular system, inflammation levels throughout the body. Any one of those things could affect the brain. ”Most likely, the effect of obesity on the brain is related to not just one cause but a combination of causes,” Gunstad says. Davidson is also moving forward by studying how to break the vicious cycle of a Western diet, obesity and brain changes. But he says the underlying idea that obesity affects the brain is clear. ”It’s surprising to me that people would question that obesity would have a negative effect on the brain, because it has a negative effect on so many other bodily systems,” he says, adding, why would ”the brain would be spared?” Alan Yu is a freelance reporter who also contributes to the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong.

"Who’s the YouTube star of 2016? Adele singing carpool karaoke and the Japanese comic who made the viral     video were among the top 10 videos of the year. But there was lots of competition around the world. This month, YouTube Rewind released its list of the top 10 most popular YouTube videos in nearly 40 countries and regions, based on how many people viewed and shared them. Here’s a sampling from some of the places we cover in our blog. With nearly 6. 7 million views, Nigeria’s top video of the year features a comedic faceoff between    Emanuella Samuel and a gang of bullies nearly twice her size. ”You’re not afraid of me right?” she shouts (even though she is clearly afraid of them). The video, titled ”I’ll Beat You,” is also ranked among the top 10 most popular videos in South Africa and Uganda. Last year, a new dance  —   the na goore  —   brought out the moves in Senegal. This year, something old is new again: sabar, a traditional Senegalese dance set to energetic drumbeats and characterized by ”  lifts and springing jumps,” as a New York Times dance critic put it. Abandoned during the French colonization of the 1800s, sabar   between the 1960s and 1980s under the country’s first president in the   period as a point of national pride. The video has picked up close to 1. 4 million YouTube views. It’s the old game ”Truth or Dare” played between a dad and his son  —   part of an infomercial from India’s first furniture rental company in an attempt to woo millennial shoppers. The   ad garnered 1. 5 million views in just four days and is among the top 10 most popular videos in the country, with more than 6 million views. Dad starts off with innocent questions ”What is the capital of Nagaland” and then goes in for the kill: ”You have alcohol bottles hidden in your flat?” Perhaps it’s no surprise that Trevor Noah’s skewering of South African president Jacob Zuma was the top video of 2016 in The Daily Show host’s home country. Zuma has been facing calls to resign after having been accused of corruption and political mismanagement. In the clip, Noah pokes fun at Zuma’s use of $15 million in state funds to ”renovate his house”  —   including the installation of a pool, which Zuma said was actually a ”fire pool” whose water would be used to put out any fires. And then there’s his inability to read aloud the numeral ”769, 870.” A video of a   talk show that ponders the future of the Arabic language has racked up 9. 1 million views. The host asks some kids to name different animals. They know the English words ”giraffe,” ”crocodile” and ”owl” but go blank when asked to say the names in Arabic. And it’s not just a joke: The National, a newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, reports that experts are increasingly concerned about young Arabs speaking a hybrid language  —   usually Arabic laced with English  —   to sound more sophisticated and modern. The trailer for Disney’s Queen of Katwe  —   a movie based on a true story about a young chess champion rising out of the slums  —   was the fourth   video in the East African country, with 1. 8 million views. As NPR previously reported, this is possibly the first Disney movie to be set in the Africa with all black actors. One of the top videos of 2016 from Mexico come from the second most subscribed YouTuber in the world. A native Chilean who likes to rant, he’s known mainly by his stage name HolaSoyGerman  —   Spanish for ”hello, I am German,” which is his first name, pronounced Herman. He has over 30 million subscribers and 2. 9 billion views. His most popular video this year, in which he enthusiastically spews out a string of thoughts on food, has reached 24 million viewers. He dramatizes, for example, his frustration of opening a bag of chips only to find filled mostly with air. The original     video didn’t break Indonesia’s top 10 list, but the song itself clearly struck a chord. The   popular video in that country, with 8. 3 million views, is a version of the song by comedian Andre Taulany on an Indonesian talk show. The bit is just one of many imitations of the viral but   routine, showing that sometimes all it takes is a catchy beat and a silly dance to bring the world together."
"Here’s a quick roundup of some of the   you may have missed on this week’s Morning Edition. Clean that screen, It’s time to talk about germs. Yes, germs. In a somewhat startling announcement your smartphone may have five times more germs than a toilet seat. It’s OK, I just looked at my beloved little iPhone in disgust, too. All of this is according to the Japanese mobile company NIT, which seems to be exploiting the grossness that is your handheld device. As Morning Edition host David Greene said Monday, the company has installed special rolls of paper in bathrooms at Tokyo’s Narita Airport. The rolls look like toilet paper, except they have some writing on it, which says ”Welcome to Japan. ..wipe your smartphone with this.” The toilet paper then encourages you to log on to NIT’s wifi network and enjoy some quality web surfing. It’s probably a good idea to wipe your phone down now that you’re done reading. In cold coffee, It’s common knowledge that journalists follow the money to uncover stories. Just ask David Fahrenthold. But when it comes to the police officers, well, they follow the   coffee cups and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. At least that’s what happened with some police officers in Cheyenne, Wyo. As Morning Edition host David Greene said Tuesday, the officers have accused Zachary Munoz of burglary. They say he targeted a business called 4 Rivers Equipment and a JCPenney store. Police used DNA to connect the crimes. Apparently, Munoz left his coffee cup at JCPenney and a half eaten PBJ sandwich at the equipment store. So remember what your mother told you, DNA is evidence that can be traced, and it’s important to clean up after yourself. No one likes a messy burglar. Home for the holidays, Stuffed animals have all the fun these days. And this definitely stands true for    Eleanor Dewald’s stuffed bear, Teddy. As Morning Edition host Rachel Martin said Tuesday, Dewald was flying from Dallas to Detroit with Teddy by her side. But when she got off the plane, Teddy somehow managed to stay behind. Dewald’s mom sounded the call on social media and airline agent, or should we say modern day hero, Steven Laudeman, located the bear, who was unfortunately on top of a trash can. Before sending Teddy back, Laudeman took the fluffy fella on a tour of the plane cockpit, the tarmac and into the gift shop. Teddy snapped some pictures alongside the other stuffed animals there. Needless to say Teddy gets some major street cred and bragging rights for his holiday adventure. Raise a glass cup, What would parties and   be without some hearty libations? Sad! And what would hold the liquid courage we drink if red Solo cups weren’t there? Good question. Well New Year’s Eve parties tend to have plenty of drinks, which means there will be plenty of those red Solo cups floating around, but this year you need to raise your plastic cup to the oncoming 2017 and Robert Hulseman. Hulseman invented the red Solo cup and as Morning Edition host David Greene said Friday, the inventor died at age 84. His family told the Chicago Tribune that Hulseman knew every employee’s name and went to Catholic Mass on Sundays. Beyond his success of creating the cup, he also inspired a Toby Keith party song. So this weekend, we’ll fill them up and lift them up to Hulseman."
"Ben Johnston doesn’t follow the rules of music. Sure, he’s got degrees from two colleges and a conservatory. But from an early age, Johnston heard music differently. When he was growing up in Georgia, he questioned the standard scales he was taught in school. ”I played by ear and I invented my own chords,” he says. In Western music, we’re taught that there are set notes in scales, but there is actually an infinite number of pitches in between those notes. They’re called microtones, and those are the notes Johnston likes to work with. ”String Quartet No. 4,” Johnston’s take on ”Amazing Grace,” is probably his   and   work. At his home in Madison, Wis. surrounded by a flock of peacocks and a herd of barn cats, the    composer says the work has its roots in his childhood, in slavery and in his desire to hear what the song might have sounded like if Beethoven had covered it late in his career. It was actually Johnston’s love of the Glenn Miller Orchestra and Broadway show tunes that made him want to be a composer. Then, during World War II, he heard Stan Kenton’s band. ”It was the first time I heard real jazz improvisation,” Johnston says. ”Immediately, I could get it by ear. It changed my whole approach to harmony.” After the war, he apprenticed with the iconoclastic American composer and   Harry Partch and studied with composers Darius Milhaud and John Cage. All of them encouraged him to follow his own path. Johnston later became a mentor himself  —   he taught at the University of Illinois for over three decades. Composer Larry Polansky, who studied under Johnston there, says Johnston’s work is groundbreaking and necessary. ”We need Jackson Pollock, we need John Ashbery, we need James Joyce and we need Ben Johnston,” he says, ”because they do question something that generally goes unquestioned.” Polansky, who went on to become a professor himself, says Johnston taught him there was more to music than the standard Western scale. ”To enforce and entrain a very specific set of pitches and reify them as somehow natural . .. just doesn’t make any sense,” he says. Johnston has used all of the notes he can wrangle in dance music, percussion pieces and orchestral work, but he spent the bulk of his career  —   almost four decades  —   composing 10 unique string quartets. Johnston, who celebrated his 90th birthday this year, recently received a special present: the completion of a more than   effort to record them all. The Kepler Quartet formed in 2002 with the specific intention to record these compositions  —   and it took 14 years of rehearsing and recording to get them all down. Eric Segnitz, the group’s second violinist, says the rehearsal process required both learning and unlearning. ”There was a fair amount of invention and learning curve and getting rid of any preconception of what a chord actually sounds like,” he says. Segnitz says what struck him even more than the complexity of the music was the way Johnston has never veered from his vision. ”There are all sorts of pressures on modern composers to reach an audience, to be popular  —   it’s like high school, basically,” he says. ”So the fact that someone has cut through all that is very meaningful.” That doesn’t mean the composer can’t be playful. In his ”String Quartet No. 10,” Johnston subtly teases a traditional tune through four movements. ”You build up this enormous expectation until finally you get to the end and . .. we reveal the tune,” he says. ”It turns out to be ’Danny Boy!’ ” Johnston now wants musicians to take his ideas into the future. He sees his string quartets as a foundation, and he wants others to build upon his tunings  —   and keep making what he calls the ”sounds that people never thought they wanted to hear.”"
"David Bowie, Prince and George Michael are all pop icons who died in 2016. But there is something else that connects them: They all helped to redefine the concept of masculinity in pop culture. Cultural critic Wesley Morris has been thinking about how these artists performed gender and sexuality. He recently wrote in The New York Times that in today’s climate, ”The Princes and the George Michaels seem as radical as ever.” Morris joined NPR’s Ari Shapiro to discuss how Bowie, Prince and Michael called upon their audiences to reimagine what it is to be a man. Hear their full conversation at the audio link and read an edited transcript below. Ari Shapiro: Let’s start with David Bowie. He was the oldest of the three, and he kind of paved the way in the 1970s. How do you think he changed our view of manliness? Wesley Morris: Sort of by suggesting that it didn’t exist, for at least the first 10 or 11 years of his career. He was part of a wave of artists who were interested in  —   and I don’t know how conscious it was  —   but it definitely was a reaction against a kind of standard notion [of what] men are supposed to do, any sort of male cliché. So paint a picture of what he did  —   how he performed his version of what it meant to be a man. For one thing, he was limber. He seemed very loose. He was what I imagine the people who might have tormented him, or tormented kids like him, would have called a ”sissy”  —   on the nicer end, I guess, the less mean end. I think that he was really interested in his femininity more than he was interested in his masculinity. He spent a lot of time creating these personae that were androgynous  —   they weren’t from this planet. Right. As much as he dissolved the border between male and female, he also kind of dissolved the border between human and alien. I mean, he made every aspect of what was normal about being human seem foreign. I think that Ziggy Stardust period was probably the most obviously queer period that he performed in. He was interested in this makeup and these platforms and this hair, and it was neither male nor female, and I think that was what was so disconcerting about him. But also, if you were a kid, it was kind of weirdly exciting, because these ideas of gender and masculinity and femininity are these acquired notions. I think that if you’re ignorant of what they signify, you see this person signifying none of it and it kind of blows your mind. Prince was 12 years younger he took what David Bowie did and ran with it. How would you describe the way he evolved from the version of masculinity that Bowie presented? It was incredibly sexual. Not only was he interested in acquiring it  —   he liked having it. He liked making sure the person he was having it with was happy. And yet he sang about it in his very falsetto voice that doesn’t sound typically masculine at all. No, no. And it has a tradition in popular music, obviously: He’s doing what people like Little Richard do. I mean, he was a seducer, [but] he wasn’t doing the thing that a lot of RB artists were doing  —   like ”Yeah, baby, you and me. We got something so special.” He doesn’t turn the lights low. And he he’s also doing it while wearing boas, high heels, eyeliner, makeup. And if not being a man in the way that we think of men was something that didn’t hurt your art or hurt your sales, then why not continue to pursue it? The thing about the ’80s in particular was just how   we had become. There was the burgeoning of the American action movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s career as an action hero began. Sylvester Stallone moving from Rocky not just to Rambo, but to things like Cobra and Over The Top. This was a time when Michael Douglas was the sexiest man alive. And people who were gay, defying gender norms, were dying of AIDS. Yes. And so you have this tension between straight culture  —   and you have, in somebody like Prince, this person who is really queering the difference between these two. He was singing about heterosexual sex while looking anything but conventionally heterosexual. How do you explain the success of Bowie and Prince and these other   pop stars in an era of such  ? Their songs were good. [Laughs] Let’s get to the third member of this trifecta of musicians who exploded masculinity and who died in 2016  —   and that is George Michael. What was he doing that was different from Bowie or Prince? He seemed to be the person who was most clearly gay. Well, he was. I mean, unlike the other two, he was gay. Right, but at the height of his popularity, he wasn’t out. But he was the person who, more than anybody else, if you had a gaydar, he set it off. That shot in the video for ”Faith” that’s focused on the seat of his jeans, just swinging back and forth. Yeah, there’s that. I think that by the time the ”Faith” video came around  —   it was his first solo album  —   he wanted to have a look that separated him from Wham! And this very sort of butch, rockabilly thing that he went for was so different than the other George Michael that it was arresting. That video just completely eroticized him: I mean, the camera is rising up his body as moving around this contraption that’s spinning. It’s great. How standard was it at that time for a male body like that to be the object of the camera’s gaze? Because it’s so much more common for the camera to gaze upon a gorgeous woman, especially in a music video. Right, like the express train to Elvis is immediate. And the express train to James Brown it goes there, too. I think the thing is that it’s immediate and it’s unmediated. You are allowed to look at this body in a way that you weren’t allowed to look at Elvis’ while he danced. It’s obviously a tragedy  —   a coincidence of the calendar  —   that all three of these artists died in 2016. But do you think that when you put the three of them together, you see something about the evolution, or maybe devolution, of masculinity in pop music? Yeah. I mean, to have that happen in a year in which we were   the propriety of maleness with regard to women, and excusing it as just the thing that men do? You’re talking about the presidential race talk about sexual assault, things like that. Yes, yes. And I think that just looking at what the coming administration is going to look like, it’s gonna be full of generals, full of men who have exerted power in this very traditional way. I think that we go through these waves, these periods. It’s gonna be really interesting to see what the next three or four years turns up  —   in terms of how you might be able to trace some   from people like your Princes and David Bowies and George Michaels to whatever is happening in music in two years."
"In November, the typically straitlaced Office of Government Ethics surprised observers with a series of tweets mimicking Donald Trump’s bombastic style, exclamation points and all: ”Brilliant! Divestiture is good for you, good for America!” The controversy was  : (1) The OGE doesn’t typically air its positions publicly, advising White House transition teams behind the scenes. (2) Trump hadn’t promised the total divestitures of business interests implied by the tweets. New records shared with NPR on Friday show that behind the curious tweets was the head of the OGE himself, Director Walter Shaub Jr. In two emails, dated Nov. 30, just several minutes apart, Shaub sent to OGE Chief of Staff Shelley Finlayson the nine tweets that took the Internet by storm that day. He then followed up with a link to a legal document referenced in one of the tweets and writes: ”Get all of these tweets posted as soon as humanly possible.” The emails were part of a   document shared with NPR in response to disclosure requests under the Freedom of Information Act. OGE is generally tasked with overseeing ethics in the executive branch of the government, and so it’s one of the agencies looking into Trump’s   business interests and the conflicts of interest they create for the   as he takes over the reins of the country in January. As NPR’s Jim Zarroli has reported: ”With his vast network of licensing deals, golf courses and commercial real estate, Trump and his family stand to profit from his presidency to an unprecedented degree. Virtually any decision Trump makes could affect part of his domestic or international business empire.” Several OGE officials did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. It’s still unclear why  —   if Shaub’s tweets were deliberate  —   they were temporarily deleted on the day they were posted. At the time, an OGE spokesman said the agency was enthused by Trump’s indicated interest (on Twitter) in avoiding conflicts of interest. Despite the stylistic peculiarity of OGE’s tweets, Shaub’s position on Trump’s conflicts of interest is not secret. He appears to be on a campaign to get Trump to divest, as shown by his lengthy letter released earlier this month. ”I think that there’s a uniform consensus among everybody who does government ethics for a living . .. that Donald Trump must divest  —   he’s got to sell his holdings or use a blind trust or the equivalent, as every president has done for 40 years,” says Norm Eisen, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ”So I took the tweets as an expression of that   view,” says Eisen, who has served as special counsel for ethics and government reform in the Obama White House. ”This is an undebatable position in our profession.” NPR had requested, under FOIA, that the agency share all emails related to the Twitter postings on Nov. 30 and related to Donald Trump. Only one exchange appeared to involve a member of the Trump team. On the day of the tweetstorm, Shaub emailed ”D. McGahn”  —   presumably Donald McGahn, the former chief of the Federal Election Commission whom Trump picked to be White House counsel  —   to notify him of the press inquiries and the OGE’s response. OGE redacted about 15 pages among a week’s worth of emails, describing them as ”draft” or ”internal notes” or ”draft communications plan.” The vast majority of the disclosures were media inquiries from the month of November  —   but also troves of messages from members of the public received around the time of the tweets. There are dozens and dozens of emails, letters and even a postcard (of Alexander Hamilton with a black eye?) expressing concerns about Trump’s business holdings and conflicts of interest. Many writers criticized OGE’s tweetstorm others welcomed its candid commentary. Most writers encouraged OGE to hold up the ethics law and standards. NPR’s Jim Zarroli contributed to this report."
"This is the time of year when everybody is making predictions for next year, and everybody is making resolutions for the things they plan to do. But it’s a Pop Culture Happy Hour tradition that while we do these things too, we also revisit the ones from last year to see whether we have any ability to know what’s going to happen (rarely!) and any tendency to follow through on our own plans (sometimes! ). As she has for the last two years, Kat Chow of NPR’s Code Switch team sits down with us to check in. What will the Oscars bring? Did Kat get her dad using Netflix? Just how much is Stephen promising to write? What habit is Glen trying to break? All this and lots, lots more on this special New Year’s edition of Pop Culture Happy Hour. Here’s Glen’s chart, by the way. As always, we close with what’s making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about sharing a new show with his kid, Glen is happy about a film that ”aches for you to be charmed by it,” Kat is happy about an upcoming book you’re sure to hear more about, and I’m happy about a feature Glen recently completed and the return of a favorite reality franchise. Thank you for listening this year, and follow us on Twitter to get good stuff in 2017: me, Stephen, Glen, Kat, producer Jessica, and producer     Mike."
"Terrorist attacks, hurricanes, a divisive U. S. election, Brexit  —   2016 has not been easy. With the year coming to an end, we thought it was time to get some serious perspective  —   from the scale of the entire universe. We’re tackling big questions: what scientists know, and what they have yet to learn. So before you ring in another year, take a moment to contemplate the billions of years that led to 2017 and the billions more yet to come. ”That happens to be my absolute favorite question,” says Chuck Bennett, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University. He points out that the   theory says the universe started out dense and hot, and that it has been expanding and cooling for 13. 8 billion years, but, he says, ”the   theory doesn’t actually say what happened right at the beginning.” You can follow our laws of physics back in time, he says, but they break down close to the start, when things were unspeakably fiery and close together. Still, there may be clues from the weird world of quantum physics. In that world, strange stuff can happen, like particles can just appear out of nowhere. ”Even if you take something that’s a complete vacuum, you’ve gotten all of the particles and dust and everything out of the way, in quantum mechanics you still have particles popping in and out of existence all the time,” explains Bennett. So maybe the kernel that became our universe just randomly and spontaneously appeared. ”It seems bizarre, but that is kind of the going thinking about this,” Bennett says. And if you want to think about something even more bizarre, consider this point made by Caltech theoretical physicist Sean Carroll. If the big bang was the first moment in time, that creates a conundrum: ”There’s no verbs before time itself exists, right? There’s no popping into existence, there’s no fluctuating, there’s no quantum mechanical craziness, there is literally nothing,” says Carroll. You might be tempted to try to answer this question by stepping outside the universe so you can take a gander. But, obviously, that’s impossible. ”There is no such thing as outside the universe, as far as we can tell,” says Carroll. Even though the universe has been expanding for about 14 billion years, that doesn’t mean it’s ballooning out into some other realm. ”I know it’s difficult to wrap our minds around,” says Carroll, ”but it’s just getting more and more of it, even though it’s not expanding into anything at all.” So if we can’t leave the universe, all we can do is look around inside. Let’s say you flew off the Earth, out of our solar system, out of the Milky Way galaxy, out of our cluster of galaxies, and flew on and on. How far could you go? ”We don’t 100 percent know,” says Janna Levin, a theoretical physicist at Columbia University. ”What we see of the universe is vast. We know that the universe is something like 90 billion   across.” But that’s just the part we can see. Anything beyond that has to remain a mystery, because stuff out there is so far away, its light will never be able to reach us. ”It makes logical sense to assume the universe goes on beyond that boundary. It would be kind of magical if we were just happening to be able to see right to some boundary and then something crazy happened beyond that, like galaxies ceased to exist,” says Levin. ”I mean, that just seems nuts.” So the universe goes on, but is it infinite? ”It is somewhat unimaginable but quite possible that our universe simply goes on forever,” says Bennett. To us, the universe seems flat, so maybe it’s like an endless sheet of paper. But on the other hand, people used to think the Earth was flat, too, because people saw flat land stretching to a horizon, beyond which they could not see. These days, the idea of a flat Earth seems silly  —   we know it’s really a huge sphere. ”Our universe might be like that,” says Bennett, noting that the universe might be curved and might even curve back on itself like a sphere, ”but on a scale that is truly enormous.” If so, and you headed off into the universe, going straight in one direction, you would eventually find yourself right back where you started. You might think this is one of the easier questions about the universe to answer. But you would be wrong. ”All the stuff we’ve ever seen in the laboratory, all the kinds of particles and matter and energy, that only makes up 5 percent of our universe,” says Carroll. Five percent! So what is the rest of the universe made of? Well, one biggie is something called dark matter. About 25 percent of the universe is dark matter, which is quite literally dark. ”It just doesn’t interact with light at all,” says Bennett. ”It doesn’t give off any light it doesn’t absorb light it doesn’t scatter light there’s no way to see it. The only way we know that it’s there is because it has gravitational effects.” Scientists discovered dark matter when they looked at the motion of galaxies and realized that something unseen had to be exerting a gravitational pull. Dark matter may be some kind of particle that we just haven’t detected yet. The rest of the universe  —   70 percent  —   is something even more crazy, called dark energy. It appears to be some kind of energy that’s inherent to empty space, and it acts to push the universe apart, speeding up its expansion. Like dark matter, dark energy is another big mystery. ”Other than the fact that we don’t quite understand 95 percent of the universe, we’re doing really well,” jokes Bennett. All of the world’s leading theoreticians, who write whole books about the universe, just have to live with this state of affairs. ”You’re entitled to say, if you’re so smart, why don’t you tell me what that dark matter is? And I’ll have to confess I don’t know,” says Jim Peebles, Albert Einstein professor of science, emeritus and professor of physics, emeritus at Princeton University. He’s not depressed, however, that so much of the universe remains unknown. ”I think I’d be depressed if everything were nearly all known,” says Peebles, ”but I don’t feel any danger of that happening.” Let’s face it people tend to be pretty  . ”If you look back at the history of astronomy, you know, we used to think that the Earth was the center of the solar system. Everything was about us,” says Bennett. Even when we figured out that Earth went around the sun, and the sun was part of the Milky Way galaxy, we thought our galaxy was the center of the universe. ”Then we learned no, it’s just one galaxy out of hundreds of billions of galaxies out there,” he notes. With that track record in mind, it’s natural to wonder whether our whole universe isn’t so special  —   if it’s just one among many. ”We don’t know yet,” says Bennett, ”but it’s very possible.” Given that scientists believe the seed that started our universe may have spontaneously popped into existence through a kind of quantum weirdness, that presents an obvious question: If that could happen once, why not more than once? ”So then you have this kind of array of universes in which ours is not unique,” says Bennett. How many universes could there be? ”A really, really big number,” says Carroll. But since everything we can observe and poke and prod is, by definition, part of our universe, it’s unclear how we could ever detect some other universe. This is why some thinkers worry that pondering the   multiverse is more like philosophy than science. It’s sort of fun to think about whether our universe is solitary, and it’s a legitimate question, says Peebles, ”but since we’ll never be able to answer it, I can’t get very excited.” But maybe this idea could be testable. Imagine if you had two universes that were expanding and ran into each other, says Bennett. If another universe bumped into ours, there could be ways to tell. In fact, there have been efforts to search the skies for evidence of that kind of impact, but there’s no sign it ever happened. Which might be a good thing, since that kind of event ”would be very dangerous at least for people in one of the universes or the other because one of them would probably be destroyed,” Bennett says. ”Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice,” wrote Robert Frost in his famous poem Fire and Ice. He favored fire but, hedging his bet, added that: I think I know enough of hate  To say that for destruction ice  Is also great  And would suffice. These days, most astrophysicists are guessing the universe will end as cold as ice. The universe, which started out hot and dense, has been expanding and cooling for nearly 14 billion years. We now know it’s actually expanding faster and faster. ”This is like hyperdrive on the cooling,” says Bennett. ”So it’s the ice solution. Everything would grow dimmer and dimmer you would stop seeing things in the sky everything would grow dark and cold.” As everything gets farther and farther apart, each particle of the universe will eventually end up completely alone. It all sounds bleak. But, cheer up! Ending with fire is still possible. Since dark energy is pushing the universe to expand faster and faster, and physicists don’t know what dark energy is, it’s possible that it might just decay or go away, making our expanding universe slow down. ”Maybe even reverse its course for all we know, and then what? Then we go back to kind of a fiery end,” says Levin. She explains that everything would fly back together toward a big crunch, which is like the big bang happening in reverse. Fire or ice, either way, the end is coming. But not for a long while. ”We think it will be at least a quadrillion years before the last star burns out,” says Carroll, noting that this is 1, 000 trillion years. Our own sun will burn out way sooner, in about 5 billion years. Though Carroll says that’s kind of a parochial concern, when you consider that our Milky Way galaxy has around 100 billion stars and is just one of trillions of galaxies. ”So we are not significant on the cosmic scale. We are not important to the universe. That’s the bad news,” says Carroll. The good news is that, even with our puny brains, we’ve managed to figure that out."
"We all experience stress at work, no matter the job. But for teachers, the work seems to be getting harder and the stress harder to shake. A new report out this month pulls together some stark numbers on this:   percent of teachers say they feel high daily stress. That’s on par with nurses and physicians. And roughly half of teachers agree with this statement: ”The stress and disappointments involved in teaching at this school aren’t really worth it.” It’s a problem for all of us  —   not just these unhappy teachers. Here’s why: ”Between 30 and 40 percent of teachers leave the profession in their first five years,” says Mark Greenberg, a professor of human development and psychology at Penn State. And that turnover, he says, costs schools  —   and taxpayers  —   billions of dollars a year, while research (like this and this) suggests teacher burnout hurts student achievement, too. Greenberg has studied America’s schools for more than 40 years, and, with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (also an NPR funder) he helped author the new brief exploring teacher stress. He says teachers feel frazzled for many reasons, including   testing and the fact that many students are themselves coming to school stressed. As for the fixes, Greenberg recommends a few. New teachers who receive steady mentoring are less likely to quit. Workplace wellness programs can also help. But both require schoolwide, even districtwide  . If that’s not realistic, Greenberg suggests a fix that is well within every teacher’s control, one that just might surprise you . .. Mindfulness, That’s right, mindfulness. For teachers. Patricia Jennings wrote the book on it (literally). It’s called Mindfulness For Teachers. Jennings was a teacher herself for two decades and now studies stress in the classroom as a professor and researcher at the University of Virginia. The Journal of Educational Psychology will soon publish a study of her work in New York City, teaching mindfulness to more than 200 educators in   schools. Jennings says the teachers who received mindfulness training ”showed reduced psychological distress and time urgency  —   which is this feeling like you don’t have enough time. And then improvements in mindfulness and emotion regulation.” Translation: These teachers were better able to cope with classroom challenges and manage their feelings, which made it easier for them to manage their students’ big feelings. And that, says Jennings, helps students learn. What is mindfulness? Definitions vary, but Jennings likes to think of it this way: attending to things in the moment with curiosity and acceptance. If this all sounds a bit . .. squishy, rest assured, there’s even research on how mindfulness can help reduce stress in U. S. Marines preparing for deployment. Meria Carstarphen is not a teacher but knows a thing or two about classroom stress. She has run a couple of big city school systems and is now superintendent in Atlanta. Carstarphen says she advises new teachers: You can’t take care of your students if you don’t take care of yourself. ”Put your oxygen mask on first,” she tells her rookies. ”Then we’ll talk about everybody else.”"
"When John Fahey recorded The New Possibility in 1968 to make a few bucks off Christmas sales every year, his album title turned out to be emblematic of the solo guitar’s potential. The music grows decades later, rung out in steel vibration and wrung out from tradition. In 2016, there was an incredible bounty of guitar music across Americana, jazz, ambient, psychedelic, experimental music and what Fahey labeled American Primitive. For sake of focus, these 10 unranked records (and a few honorable mentions) were all primarily made by one person with the guitar as the primary instrument. That’s why you don’t see the stellar records made by Chris Forsyth, Mary Halvorson, William Tyler or Cian Nugent this year, as they were backed by bands that understand their singular approaches to the instrument. Instead, these records celebrate new possibilities in the solo exploration of six and 12 strings."

"From West Virginia to Wyoming, coal country overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump and his message that he will bring coal jobs back. Now, those same voters are eyeing his incoming administration closely, careful to see if he will keep his promises to revive the coal industry and get miners back to work. These hopes have become increasingly desperate as the industry has floundered. U. S. coal production in 2016 is projected to be at its lowest level since 1978, and over the past few years, the country has lost about 30, 000 coal jobs. That means hard times for places like Wyoming’s   Powder River Basin. Three of the region’s four main coal producers were in bankruptcy in 2016. Two of them laid off hundreds of miners at once. Still, the community of Gillette, Wyo.  —     as the Energy Capital of the Nation  —   is breathing a sigh of relief lately. Production has ticked back up past where it was at this time last year, and some mines are even hiring workers back. ”I do believe that my friends and   are safe for now,” says coal miner Stacey Moeller. She believes that ”for one more year, we’re going to be coal miners.” And Trump’s win has buoyed her hopes, as well as those of investors. The day after the election, coal stock prices leaped and many in coal communities celebrated. For Moeller, a single mom and lifelong Democrat, the decision was complicated. ”I did vote for Donald Trump,” Moeller says. ”It’s really hard to even say that because I so dislike his rhetoric. But I voted for him on one singular issue, and that was coal.” She’s not alone. Dave Hathaway of Pennsylvania will be watching Trump, as well. Since the coal mine he worked in closed a year ago, he spent much of 2016 looking for work. The search gained urgency when his son Deacon was born in August. On Election Day, Hathaway made a choice he hopes will help his   job prospects. ”I voted for Trump  —   I mean, a coal miner would be stupid not to,” Hathaway says. He says he’s had a hard time finding a job to replace the $80, 000 he made working in the coal mines under Greene County, Pa. a few miles from the West Virginia border. Hathaway recently found a job at a nearby mine. While he thinks Trump’s election means he’ll have a better shot at keeping his new job, he didn’t like a lot of things Trump said during the campaign. ”He is a whacko he’s never going to stop being a whacko,” Hathaway says. ”But I mean, the things he did say  —   the good stuff  —   was good for the coal mining community. But we’ll see what happens.” That message clearly resonated in Greene County, where over the last four years a third of the coal mining jobs  —   like Dave Hathaway’s  —   disappeared. Trump won the county by 40 points, eight years after Barack Obama basically tied John McCain there. Tom Crooks, vice president at R. G. Johnson, a construction company that builds mine shafts, witnessed the decline of the coal industry firsthand. ”Two years ago this week we had 145 employees,” Crooks says. ”Right now, we have 22.” Crooks doesn’t use the phrase ”war on coal,” but he does think federal regulations mounted by the Environmental Protection Agency under President Obama have weighed down his industry. One example is the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. That rule, which Trump has pledged to eliminate, limits the amount of carbon dioxide from   power plants. Instead, Crooks wants to see more government research into making coal as clean as possible. ”Really, what’s happened over the last eight years is the smart people stopped working on coal, in part because of the way the federal government and the state governments looked at us,” Crooks says. ”We just want them to start looking to coal as an option.” Leigh Paterson is a reporter with Inside Energy, a public media collaboration focusing on America’s energy issues.

"Updated Jan. 1 at 9:56 a. m. ET, At least 39 people were killed and 69 others wounded during New Year’s celebrations Saturday after a gunman opened fire at an Istanbul nightclub. At least 16 of those killed were foreign nationals. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told reporters that the attacker entered the Reina nightclub and began shooting at random, NPR’s Peter Kenyon tells our newscast. The killer then changed clothes and left, says the minister. The manhunt for the attacker, who has not yet been identified, is still underway, Soylu adds, as police believe he carried out the attack alone. Provincial Gov. Vasip Sahin has described the incident as a terrorist attack. ”A terrorist with a   weapon . .. brutally and savagely carried out this incident by firing bullets on innocent people who were there solely to celebrate the New Year and have fun,” Sahin told reporters. At Reina, one of the city’s most popular nightclubs, it’s believed some 500 to 600 revelers were celebrating the start of the new year. Reuters reports that the attacker shot at a police officer and at civilians before entering the nightclub. Many inside were said to have jumped into the neighboring Bosphorus waterway in an attempt to save themselves from the gunfire. A Turkish cabinet minister told the   Anatolia News Agency that citizens of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Libya and Lebanon are among the dead, Peter reports. In addition, the Israeli Foreign Ministry says a young   woman was killed in the attack. Peter adds: ”The interior minister named several possible culprits, including Islamic State, Kurdish militants or   groups.” According to the Associated Press, several ambulances and police vehicles were dispatched to the scene, an area described as ”on the shore of the Bosphorus Strait in the Ortakoy district.” The cosmopolitan neighborhood is home to many clubs, restaurants and art galleries. Says Reuters: ”Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital Ankara. In Istanbul, 17, 000 police officers were put on duty, some camouflaged as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, state news agency Anadolu reported.” This latest attack comes just two weeks after Russian ambassador, Andrei Karlov, was shot dead by   Turkish policeman Mevlut Mert Altintas and three weeks after a bomb attack killed 44 people at a football stadium in Istanbul. A Kurdish militant group claimed responsibility for the latter. Turkey, which is part of the U. S.  coalition against Islamic State, has faced numerous security threats. In all, there were at least six attacks in Turkey in 2016, claiming more than 200 lives. Meantime, the White House is condemning the attack, calling it a ”horrific terrorist attack” and offering to assist Turkey. According to the AP, White House spokesman Eric Schultz says President Obama  —   who is vacationing with his family in Hawaii  —   ”was briefed on the attack by his national security team and asked to be updated as the situation develops.” The AP adds: ”White House National Security Council spokesman Ned Price says the attack on ’innocent revelers’ celebrating New Year’s shows the attackers’ savagery. He says the U. S. sends thoughts and prayers to the relatives of those killed. ”Price says the U. S. supports its NATO ally Turkey as both countries fight terrorism.” Turkey’s Bloody Year, ”It was a horrible year,” journalist Mustafa Akyol told NPR’s Ailsa Chang on Sunday morning. ”We had a bloody coup attempt . .. almost 300 people were killed, then a very brutal crackdown began after that and thousands of people found themselves in jail with, I think, exaggerated charges in my view  —   at least some of them. ”Then, the terror attacks, both the PKK  —   which is a Kurdist, separatist group with a   secular ideology, and ISIS. They both organized major attacks inside Turkey.” Akyol’s latest column, published just hours before the attack, enumerated the many tragic events of 2016, calling it Turkey’s ”worst year ever.” ”And you know what is the worst?” he writes. ”There is no guarantee that the future will be any better. There is no assurance that all this will prove to be a temporary crisis rather than the new normal.” ”What we need at this time is not more conspiracy theories,” Akyol told NPR. ”Not a more authoritarian government. But really, national unity based on understanding and tolerance and reconciliation. We’re not there though, unfortunately yet.”"
"On the morning of Jan. 1, Los Angeles residents and visitors alike awoke to see the iconic Hollywood sign had been altered overnight. Some were delighted. A number of posts on Instagram Sunday are captioned things like, ”I love this city!” and ”Let’s keep it!” Police were, perhaps, less amused: They were investigating the vandalism Sunday, and said the male prankster was recorded by security cameras wearing all black at around 3 a. m. He could face a misdemeanor trespassing charge if caught. This actually isn’t the first time this has happened. Whether it was a tribute, or an accident, the vandal mimicked a similar prank that was done 41 years ago today by Daniel Finegood, on Jan. 1, 1976: The day California’s relaxed marijuana law took effect. According to the LA Times, Finegood did a number of similar stunts, changing the sign to read ”Ollywood” to protest the worship of Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North during the   hearings in 1987, and ”Oil War” in 1990 as a political statement about the Persian Gulf War. The ”Hollyweed” prank, however, seems more like a celebration than a protest. The AP suggests it might be a gesture to the approval of Proposition 64 in November, which legalized recreational use of marijuana."
"In September, reproductive endocrinologist John Zhang and his team at the New Hope Fertility Center in New York City captured the world’s attention when they announced the birth of a child to a mother carrying a fatal genetic defect. Using a technique called mitochondrial replacement therapy, the researchers combined DNA from two women and one man to bypass the defect and produce a healthy baby boy  —   one with, quite literally, three genetic parents. It was heralded as a stunning technological leap for in vitro fertilization, albeit one that the team was forced to perform in Mexico, because the technique has not been approved in the United States. The technique is spreading quickly, gaining official approval this month from the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority in the U. K. The move will allow clinics to apply for permission there to carry out the treatment, with the first patients expected to be seen as early as next year. But for all the accolades, the method also has scientists concerned that the fatally flawed mitochondria can resurface to threaten a child’s health. Earlier this month, a study published in Nature by Shoukhrat Mitalipov, head of the Center for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, suggested that in roughly 15 percent of cases, the mitochondrial replacement could fail and allow fatal defects to return, or even increase a child’s vulnerability to new ailments. The findings confirmed the suspicions of many researchers, and the conclusions drawn by Mitalipov and his team were unequivocal: The potential for conflicts between transplanted and original mitochondrial genomes is real, and more sophisticated matching of donor and recipient eggs  —   pairing mothers whose mitochondria share genetic similarities, for example  —   is needed to avoid potential tragedies. ”This study shows the potential as well as the risks of gene therapy in the germline,” Mitalipov says. This is especially true of mitochondria, because its genomes are so different than the genomes in the nucleus of cells. Slight variations between mitochondrial genomes, he adds, ”turn out to matter a great deal.” Mitochondria are the energy powerhouses inside our cells, and they carry their own DNA, separate from our nuclear genome. The danger lies in the fact that mitochondria are in some ways like aliens inside our cells. Two billion years ago they were   bacteria basking in the primordial soup. Then one such microbe merged with another   bacterium, and over evolutionary time, the two formed a complete cell. The bacteria eventually evolved into mitochondria, migrating most of their genes to the cell nucleus and keeping just a few dozen, largely to help them produce energy. Today, our nuclear genome contains around 20, 000 genes, while a scant 37 genes reside in the mitochondria. And yet the two genomes are intensely symbiotic: 99 percent of mitochondrial proteins are incorporated from the nucleus. Mitochondria also still divide and replicate like the bacteria they once were, and that constant replication means that mutations arise 10 to 30 times more often in mitochondrial genes than in the nucleus. If too many mitochondria become dysfunctional, the entire cell suffers and serious health problems can result. Faulty mitochondria are implicated in genetic diseases, as well as many chronic conditions from infertility to cancer, cardiac disease and neurodegenerative diseases. That’s because when mitochondria falter, the energy system of the cell itself is compromised. A   baby could solve the problem by overriding faulty mitochondria, but it also raises the stakes, because the procedure does not completely replace the defective mitochondria with healthy ones. When the mother’s nucleus is transferred, it’s like a plant dug up out of ground  —   a bit of the original soil (in this case, the mother’s mitochondria) is still clinging to the roots. That creates a situation that never happens in nature: Two different mitochondrial genomes from two different women are forced to live inside the same cell. In most cases, a tiny percentage (usually less than 2 percent) of the diseased mitochondria remain  —   but that tiny percentage can really matter. In his new study, Mitalipov crafted   embryos from the eggs of three mothers carrying mutant mitochondrial DNA and from the eggs of 11 healthy women. The embryos were then tweaked to become embryonic stem cells that could live forever, so they could be multiplied and studied. In three cases, the original maternal mitochondrial DNA returned. ”That original, maternal mitochondrial DNA took over,” Mitalipov says, ”and it was pretty drastic. There was less than 1 percent of the original maternal mitochondrial DNA present after replacement with donor DNA and before fertilization, and yet it took over the whole cell later.” Mitalipov warns that this reversal might not only occur in the embryonic stem cells it could also occur in the womb at some point during the development of a baby. Complicating things further, Mitalipov found that some mitochondrial DNA stimulates cells to divide more rapidly, which would mean that a cells containing the maternal mitochondrial DNA could eventually dominate as the embryo developed. Some mitochondrial genomes replicate much faster than others, says University of California molecular biologist Patrick O’Farrell, who called Mitalipov’s research both impressive and in keeping with his own thinking on the matter. A diseased mitochondrial genome could behave like a   bully, O’Farrell says,   and having a large impact on the   baby at any time. It could also affect that child’s future offspring. ”The diseased genome might stage a sneak comeback to afflict subsequent generations,” O’Farrell says. On the other hand, he says, the   could act as ”superheroes,” if they carry healthy, fit DNA that is able to   a mutant genome. The nuclear genes donated by a father could also influence the behavior of the mitochondria in ways we cannot yet predict, O’Farrell says. For example, the father might introduce new genes that favor the replication rate of a defective bully genome. Or the father might introduce genes that help a ”wimpy” healthy genome survive and thrive. Mitalipov’s proposed solution to the problem is to match the mitochondria of the mother and the donor, since not all mitochondria are alike. Human mitochondria all over the earth are in a sense a billion or more clones of their original mother, passed down in endless biblical begats from mother to child. Yet, even as clones, they have diverged over time into lineages with different characteristics. These are called haplotypes. O’Farrell mentions blood types as a comparison. Just as you would not want to transfuse blood type A into someone with blood type B, you might not want to mix different lineages. And while he says he thinks the idea of matching lineages is brilliant, he suggests going a step further. ”I say let’s . .. try to get a match with the dominating genome so that the defective genome will ultimately be completely displaced.” In fact, he adds, the ideal would be to look for one superhero genome, the fastest replicator of all  —   one that could displace any diseased genome. To find out which branches are super replicators, O’Farrell hopes to collaborate with other laboratories and test the competitive strength of different haplotypes. Earlier this year, O’Farrell’s laboratory published work showing that competition between closely related genomes tends to favor the most beneficial, while matchups between distantly related genomes favor super replicators with negative or even lethal consequences. There are, he says, at least 10 major lineages that would be distinct enough to be highly relevant. Mitalipov says that most of the time, matching haplotypes should ensure successful mitochondrial transfers. However, he cautions that even then, tiny differences in the region of the mitochondrial genome that controls replication speed could cause an unexpected surprise. Even in mitochondria from the same haplotype, there could be a single change in a gene that could cause a conflict, he says. In his study, Mitalipov zeroes in on the region that appears responsible for replication speed. In order to find out a mother’s haplotype, he says, full sequencing is necessary, and this region from the donor’s egg should also be looked at to be sure it matches the mother’s. Today, it costs a few hundred dollars to sequence a woman’s mitochondrial genome. But battles between mitochondrial genomes are only one part of the emerging story. Some research suggests that nuclear genes evolve to sync well with a mitochondrial haplotype, and that when the pairing is suddenly switched, health might be compromised. Research in fruit flies and in tiny sea creatures called cephalopods shows that when the ”mitonuclear” partnership diverges too much, infertility and poor health can result. In some cases, however, the divergent pairs are above average and can actually lead to better health. Swapping as little as 0. 2 percent of mitochondrial DNA in laboratory animals ”can have profound effects on the function of cells, organs, and even the whole organism, and these effects manifest late in life,” according to mitochondrial biologist Patrick Chinnery of the University of Cambridge, writing in November in The New England Journal of Medicine. Because of all these unknowns, a U. S. panel recommended last February that mitochondrial replacement therapy, if approved, implant only male embryos so that the   mitochondrial germline would not be passed down through the generations. Most scientists approve of this advice, but biologist Damian Dowling of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, has reservations about even this solution. His own research in fruit flies shows that males may actually be more vulnerable than females to impaired health from mitochondrial replacement. Since females pass on mitochondria, natural selection will help daughters sift out any mutations that might be harmful to them, and keep their nuclear and mitochondrial genes well matched. Males aren’t so lucky: If mutations don’t harm females but do harm males, the males may have to suffer impaired fertility and go to their graves earlier. This is known as the ”mother’s curse”  —   a term coined by geneticist Neil Gemmell of the University of Otago in New Zealand to describe the biological baggage that mothers unwittingly pass down to their male babies. The bottom line, according to biologist David Rand of Brown University, who studies mitochondrial genomes, is that when you swap mitochondria, the reaction is ”highly unpredictable.” And that’s why many experts are calling for caution even amid all the excitement following the   Mexico trial  —   though there is reason to believe they aren’t being heard. A   baby has now been born in China, and two more may soon be born in Ukraine, according to Nature News. Zhang, meanwhile, continues to encourage potential patients in Mexico: ”We have received interest both locally and abroad,” he says, ”and we invite people to learn more about the treatment.” Doug Wallace, head of the Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, is among those calling for a more methodical approach to the technique, though he says he doesn’t think there’s any way to put the brakes on now. ”I think what’s happened is we’re going to see more and more trials and some families are going to be exceedingly fortunate  —   and perhaps some will be an unfortunate part of the learning set.” Research on mitochondria has to catch up, Wallace says, and while matching haplotypes is a good idea, it isn’t so easy to do in practice. ”Finding women to be egg donors is going to be a major limitation,” he says  —   especially when you’d first have to survey a large group to find compatible mitochondrial DNA. Still, for women desperate to conceive a healthy child this may seem reasonable. Wallace adds that mitochondrial replacement therapy might find favor even outside those seeking to avoid passing on fatal genetic mutations  —   such as older women simply facing reduced fertility. ”There’s no proof that’s the case,” he says, but if it came to pass, that could mean a therapy that might change the DNA of tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of babies conceived by this method. That would have a real impact on the   future of society, Wallace adds, and we don’t yet fully understand all of the implications. ”I think it’s an exciting possibility,” he says, ”but also a little disconcerting.” Jill Neimark is an   science journalist and an author of adult and children’s books.

"In an effort to take advantage of the intimate relationships between stylists and their clients, a new law in Illinois will require salon professionals to receive training in domestic   as part of their licensing process.

Rowan says that clients do sometimes talk to her about what is going on in their lives. ”And sometimes they tell you so much they never come back again, because they’re afraid, or they’re embarrassed, they don’t know what to do.” ”I’ve had women, you know, when you’re washing their hair, they have bumps on their head, you know, they ’ran into a door again,’ ” Rowan says. ”I’ve been a hairdresser for 41 years. One in three women have violence in their lives. So yes, I have talked to women.” The training that the stylists will receive is an hourlong ”awareness and education” program called Listen. Support. Connect. It was designed by Chicago Says No More, a coalition of domestic violence advocacy groups, in partnership with Cosmetologists Chicago. Kristie Paskvan, the founder of Chicago Says No More, says she knows that an hourlong training isn’t going to make anyone an expert. ”We’re not asking the salon professionals to intervene. We’re just asking them to have the tools in case the clients ask for information,” she says. ”There’s something like 88, 000 salon professionals that will be trained in the next two years,” Paskvan says. ”That’s 88, 000 more individuals that will be able to have conversations with family and friends and clients, and that raises awareness about domestic violence and sexual assault.”"
"Much has been said about the physical and psychological injuries of war, like traumatic brain injury or   stress disorder. But what we talk about less is how these conditions affect the sexual relationships of service members after they return from combat. Since 2000, service members who were deployed received at least 138, 000 diagnoses of PTSD. More than 350, 000 have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury since 2000. Evidence suggests the numbers are actually higher because many don’t seek treatment. These conditions cause their own sexual side effects, such as emotional numbness, loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. And the long list of medications used to treat PTSD, TBI and other medical conditions can worsen those side effects. ’He would sleep for days’ Chuck and Liz Rotenberry of Baltimore struggled with their own challenges when Chuck returned from Afghanistan in 2011. He’s a former Marine gunnery sergeant who trained military working dogs. He left active duty in 2012. She is an Elizabeth Dole caregiver fellow, a spokesperson on issues chosen by the military caregiving foundation. For Liz and Chuck, sex had never been a problem. They’ve been married for 14 years and they’re still very much in love. Liz says she fell for Chuck in high school. He was that guy who could always make her laugh, who always had a   ready and never seemed sad. But when Chuck returned from Afghanistan, their relationship would soon face its greatest challenge. Baby No. 4 was just two weeks away for sure, it was a chaotic time. But Liz noticed pretty quickly something was terribly wrong with her husband. ”I wouldn’t be able to find him in the house and he wouldn’t be outside, and I’d find him in a separate bedroom just crying,” Liz says. ”He would sleep for days. He would have a hoodie on and be just tucked away in the bed, and he wouldn’t be able to get out of bed. He would have migraines that were so debilitating that it kept him in the bed.” When Chuck was in Afghanistan, an IED  —   improvised explosive device  —   exploded 3 feet behind him. Shrapnel lodged into his neck and back. It would take three years for someone at the Department of Veterans Affairs to explicitly lay out for Liz that Chuck had developed severe   stress and suffered a traumatic brain injury  —   and that she would need to be his caregiver. The Marine   During that   period, there were times Chuck estimates he was taking 15 to 16 different medications twice a day. Sex was usually the furthest thing from his mind. ”I didn’t think about it. I wanted to be with Liz, I wanted to be near her,” he says. ”When the desire was there, it was unique. It was rare, as opposed to the way it was before. And a lot of times, with the mountains of medication I was on, you know, in my head [it was] all systems go, but that message didn’t go anywhere else.” Liz noticed that Chuck stopped initiating physical affection. ”The thought of him reaching out to me to give me a hug wasn’t existent. It was like I had to give him the hug. I now had to step in and show him love,” she says. Sometimes months would go by before they would have sex. ”It started off as being pretty embarrassing, pretty emasculating,” Chuck says. ”It was like, ’Really? This too doesn’t work?’ You blame it on, ’Oh, it’s just the medication,’ or ’You’re tired,’ or whatever initially, and you don’t realize it’s stress or my brain just doesn’t work like it used to.” Liz and Chuck had never really talked about sex in any serious way before. So they kept avoiding the conversation  —   until this year. That’s when Chuck finally asked his primary care provider for help. The doctor prescribed four doses of Viagra a month. Liz and Chuck say the medication has improved things substantially  —   though they joke about how few doses the VA allots them every month. But asking for just those four doses took Chuck three or four visits to the doctor before he could work up the nerve. He says it can be especially hard for a Marine to admit he’s having problems with sex because it contradicts a   so many Marines have. ”You know, as a Marine, you can do anything. You believe you can do anything, you’ve been trained to do nearly anything,” he says. ”You’re physically fit. You’re mentally sound. Those are just the basics about being a Marine.” If he has any advice for a Marine going through the same thing he and his wife are facing, he says you need to talk about it. Bring it up with your spouse. Bring it up with your doctors. ”Marines always jokingly hand out straws. You got to suck it up. You got to do what you need to do to get it done,” Chuck says. ”It’s just a different mission. . .. Don’t let your pride ruin what you worked so hard for.”"

"On New Year’s Day, Portland restaurant Ava Gene’s will be serving brunch to the hungry and   masses. And amidst the frittatas, French toast, and grits, there will be Chef Josh McFadden’s own favorite: pasta carbonara. McFadden, who has cooked carbonara at New York Italian restaurants, fell in love with it for breakfast while living at the American Academy in Rome. A plate of spaghetti doesn’t look anything like your local greasy spoon’s    special, but McFadden says the dish is a whole lot more familiar than you might think. ”It’s literally the same thing as taking toast, putting an egg on the toast, and then putting said toast in your mouth. And with coffee? Amazing.” Yes, the refined starch takes the form of noodles. But the other basic breakfast building blocks  —   including a dose of something in the bacon family  —   are the same. Hot pasta (most often spaghetti) is drained and tossed with beaten eggs, cheese (Parmigiano or pecorino Romano) and cooked pork (guanciale, pancetta, and bacon all make appearances). The hot noodles cook the eggs, which set with the pork fat and residual cooking liquid to create a lusciously rich sauce, not too different from a hollandaise. So how did a dish that hits these   notes come out of Italy? According to food historian Anthony Buccini, recipes for pasta dressed with fat, eggs and cheese (cacio e uova) go back well into the 19th century. But mentions of carbonara  —   the dish that adds cured pork to the mix  —   don’t show up until after World War II. And, according to one popular theory, this might not be a coincidence. ”In effect,” says Buccini, ”the claim is that there was a joining together of American taste for  —   and supplies of  —   bacon and powdered eggs [thanks to military rations] with the local Roman love of pasta asciutta [a simple sauced dish] Roman cooks came up with the recipe to make use of the American supplies and to satisfy the foreign troops, perhaps with some prodding from those troops who missed their familiar bacon and egg combination.” It’s a beautiful story of food traditions melding and evolving. But is it true? Buccini is skeptical, noting there is ”little in the way of compelling evidence” that carbonara was inspired by American GIs, rather than being a simple variation to a large family of traditional pasta dishes. The Oxford Companion to Italian Food also rejects the WWII theory, stating: ”The absurdity of this at a time of hardship and intolerable shortages calls for no comment.” But others, like Jeremy Parzen, a food historian and translator who teaches at Italy’s University of Gastronomic Sciences, think it’s not so   to conceive of American tastes shaping Italian cuisine. ”American culture played a huge role in how Italy developed after the war,” Parzen explains. ”Essentially after the war, with the Marshall Plan, we rebuilt Europe. And whereas the French became snobbish, the Italians embraced American culture. They embraced American film, American music. .. They love their own food, but they also love food from all over the world.”  Until the definitive source of the carbonara is unearthed, the debate will continue. But there’s one thing almost all Italian chefs agree on  —   do not include cream. While this is a creamy dish, its lusciousness should come from the emulsion you get when you toss the eggs with the hot pasta and pork fat. This does require a delicate touch to get right, but it’s not much more than navigating tossing and temperature. Even with a hangover, it should be doable. And in a true nod to American palates, Chef McFadden admits that it’s not with bad with a little shake of a nice hot sauce, especially when you serve it as a   breakfast."
"U. S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts praised the   work of federal district judges in his   report on the federal judiciary, avoiding any talk of politics in regards to the country’s judicial system. Incoming president Donald Trump will have more than a 100 vacancies to fill at the district and appellate court level nationwide. He’ll also be able to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The   Congress has refused to hold a hearing on President Obama’s nominee for that empty seat. The future of those judicial vacancies was a key issue in the presidential election. Roberts’ focus, however, was on the work of lower court judges, who he called ”selfless, patriotic and brave individuals.” Congress has authorized 637 district court judgeships across the country. And the people working in those positions do so largely out of the public eye, Roberts wrote. ”You might be asking at this point why any lawyer would want a job that requires long hours, exacting skill, and intense devotion —  while promising high stress, solitary confinement, and guaranteed criticism. There are many easier and more lucrative ways for a good lawyer to earn a living. The answer lies in the rewards of public service. District judges make a difference every day, and leave a lasting legacy, by making our society more fair and just,” he wrote. The report also looked at    differences in the filings brought to the federal judiciary. The most striking difference was the number of cases in which the United States was the defendant, which increased 55 percent. Roberts wrote that the increase was due to the U. S. Supreme Court’s decision in Welch v. United States, which provided a new basis for certain prisoners convicted under the Armed Career Criminal Act to challenge their sentences. Bankruptcy petitions fell to their lowest number since 2007 and the number of defendants charged with drug and immigration crimes both showed slight decreases. Roberts wrote that the most difficult part of a judge’s job is sentencing an individual who is found guilty of a crime. He wrote: ”The judge must consider the perspectives of the prosecutor, the defendant, and the victim, and impose a penalty that, by design and necessity, will alter the direction of the defendant’s life.”"
"When Octavia Spencer first read the script for Hidden Figures  —   based on a book about the African American women who did the math for our early space launches  —   she thought it was fiction because it seemed too good to be true. Her disbelief reveals how conditioned we are to think that only white men make notable contributions to science, technology, engineering and math  —   and how important it is that we celebrate stories of the women who do. Big Hollywood movies based on true stories are an excellent way to do this. Narrative has a role to play as well, especially when it comes to another form of popular media: Romance novels, the second largest category of fiction in the U. S. Long derided as mere smut, these days romance novels feature heroines in the STEM fields  —   and the prejudices and obstacles they face on the way to a personal and professional happy ever after. The romance in Courtney Milan’s Hold Me is off to a rocky start when the hero, Jay na Thalang, assumes the heroine must be a lab supply salesperson when she shows up at his graduate studies lab. Not only is Maria Lopez a woman, she’s a pretty, ”done up” woman with an interest in shoes and planning her brother’s wedding. She cannot possibly be smart enough to be worthy of his time and attention. But unbeknownst to both Jay and Maria, they are already friends online  —   or at least their avatars are. When they meet as just minds (enabling Jay to imagine that she is a frumpy, nerdy girl) they are friends and trusted confidants who discuss problems both scientific and, eventually, personal. As long as she isn’t an undeniably sexy female body, Jay can respect her intelligence. Much of the conflict between the hero and heroine in this book stems from the hero’s assumptions about a woman’s brains based merely on her appearance what Jay comes to realize is that the problem lies with him. Even Odds by Elia Winters continues with the theme of a woman’s body getting in the way of her brain  —   not for her, but for the men in the room. Isabel Suarez, a design manager at a gaming firm, just wants to focus on the work. Whereas Maria flaunts her femininity, Isabel learned she must hide hers in order to succeed professionally, so she wears baggy clothes, pulls her hair back and smiles tightly when one coworker’s comments make her uncomfortable: ”His words were teasing, but Isabel bristled. This is what she’d wanted, though. It was better just to be sexless and professional, treated like another one of the guys, if she wanted to be taken seriously.”  Complications ensue when romance blossoms with her new coworker. Being open about their relationship means owning that she is more than just a sexless work automaton and opening herself up to judgment. Isabel only gets her happy ever after when she can allow both sides of herself to flourish  —   with the love and support of her enlightened hero (and an equally enlightened HR department). In Beginner’s Guide: Love And Other Chemical Reactions by Six de los Reyes, Kaya Rubio is happy being all brain: she lives and breathes her work as a molecular biologist and has optimized her life so she can focus on it completely. While the plot of her story is familiar  —   single girl seeks date for family wedding  —   the approach she takes is novel. When it comes to finding love, Kaya devises ”The Boyfriend Experiment” which draws on scientific principles and peer reviewed papers. Her hero is her negative control, a man so wrong he can’t possibly be right. He introduces her to romance  —   spontaneous, messy, emotional, pleasurable, utterly confounding logic and reason  —   and to another side of her herself, showing that needn’t sacrifice her heart for her brain. Being romance novels, these stories do end happily: The heroines get to be brilliant and beautiful. They can be smart and sexy and loved for it. It’s a message repeated in so many romances, whether these titles or my own historical novel, Lady Claire Is All That, which features a heroine based on Ada Lovelace, the first computer programmer. Professional success doesn’t have to come at the expense of personal happiness. It’s a message that matters, especially with regard to women and heroines in STEM. Those who develop technology we use are creating the world we live in, and having women build it is the best way to ensure that the sexism and misogyny that have held us back so far isn’t baked into our future. Stories have an important task to do here: They show all the different ways smart women can succeed personally and professionally, without having to hide their brains or their bodies in order to live happily ever after.

"If you find yourself at a loss to name even one Native American food dish, you’re not alone. But a growing number of Native chefs are trying to change that. Freddie Bitsoie is one of those chefs, working to bring back indigenous foods from centuries ago, and adapting them for today’s palate so people can learn not just about their cuisines, but their cultures too. Bitsoie found his way to the kitchen of the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D. C. in August after finishing a stint as the chef at an Indian reservation casino in New Mexico. NPR met up with Bitsoie in the museum’s bustling basement kitchen. Bitsoie has lectured on Native cuisine before, and occasionally he has put together menus for some Native American museums  —   but this is his first gig as a chef whose work is entirely devoted to preparing and spreading awareness about indigenous dishes. Bitsoie is also the first Native American chef at Mitsitam Native Foods Café. He’s a member of the Navajo tribe, and grew up in Arizona and New Mexico. As a kid, his parents spoke fluent Navajo, he says, but it wasn’t until adulthood that he grasped the impact his Native American culture had on his life. ”When you’re growing up, you’re really not aware of what your parents are trying to teach you you just want to do the things that your parents don’t want you to do,” Bitsoie says. ”Back in the ’80s when I grew up, being Native wasn’t cool, it just wasn’t the thing to do. I was lucky enough to live off of the reservation and then on the reservation, and then move back off the reservation. I had that ability to see from the inside and see from the outside.” That tug of war between native versus   insider versus outsider, might explain why Bitsoie loves bridging the old and new in his cooking. One of his signature dishes is a simple soup that has evolved across regions and across centuries  —   and then Bitsoie decided add his own twist. ”This particular clam soup is pretty much the definition of my work,” he says. ”Because with this clam soup, indigenous people from Nova Scotia to down on to Maine,   Massachusetts, had a soup that was only made with three ingredients: It was sunchoke, clam and seawater.” ”I can’t picture myself gulping seawater down voluntarily,” confesses NPR reporter Ailsa Chang. ”But at the same time, in Italian cooking people say when you cook your pasta, make sure it’s salty like the sea,” Freddie Bitsoie says. But when he cooked with NPR, Bitsoie used a substitute. ”When I look out at that ocean, I’m like, I don’t even swim in the ocean,” he laughs. Bitsoie understands that to make some traditional dishes palatable to more people, you have to tweak them. ”In developing this recipe, I wanted to still have a connection to the tribes who used to eat this dish,” he says. ”At at the same time, this was made 500, 600 years ago. So my palate is completely different from my grandmother’s palate which is even further from my grandmother’s grandmother’s palate.” So to appeal to today’s palate, he took the three original ingredients  —   clams, sunchokes and salt water  —   and added some   soup basics: leeks, onions, garlic, thyme and bay leaf. It’s a balancing act, accommodating mainstream tastes while being confident enough to hold fast to Native traditions. In the culinary world, Bitsoie says, that can difficult. ”I worked for a French chef where, when I would cook something native, all he would say is, ’You did that wrong,’ ” Bitsoie says. He adds: ”The biggest example is potatoes. When people think about potatoes, in the French style of cooking, potatoes have a bite  —   we call it ’al dente’ in the food world. But with native food, we sauté them, and we allow them to cook, but we cover them with the lid. So the potatoes aren’t only being cooked from the bottom they’re being steamed at the same time. Each culture has their own techniques, and with native cuisine we were always told, ’You’re cooking that wrong.’ And, see, I didn’t know that because I was just growing up with the way my mom cooks.” ”Look, when I got in the food business, I was looking at my mom and I said ’You’re cooking that wrong’ and I became colonized as a chef,” Bitsoie laughs. But working at the museum cafe is a whole new chapter for Bitsoie. He can call the shots  —   and figure out how he wants to integrate flavors and techniques from his own culture with his formal training as a chef. When Ailsa Chang went in for the taste test, she was surprised. ”I was expecting a saltier flavor,” she says. ”It’s very delicate, I really like it.” ”And that’s what native food is,” he says, ”it’s really delicate and innocent.” Bitsoie says that’s what he’s trying to do here  —   create new tastes and give people a new appreciation of one of America’s overlooked, and perhaps least understood cuisines."
"By day, Nicola Berlinsky and sisters Lisa Pimentel and Joanie Pimentel are all teachers at the same elementary school in southern California. By night, they’re rockers, playing together in a band called No Small Children. It sounds like a lot to balance, but the members say they often find their two careers overlapping. ”I’ll see Joanie and Lisa at work, and recess becomes a band meeting,” Berlinsky says, ”but then we start talking about our students and sharing notes about our students and really living the successes of each other’s students  —   and then we’re back at band practice again. They are so intertwined.” Joanie Pimentel says music feels like an ideal outlet given the work they do. ”It’s much cheaper than therapy,” she says, laughing. And Berlinsky says her students have generally been supportive of the project. ”They think it’s really funny,” she says. ”The parents do come to our shows, and so the children end up wearing our band   to school, which is quite something.” The three members of No Small Children joined NPR’s Ailsa Chang to talk about their work in and out of the classroom.

"It’s that time of year again, when I atone for my failure to make top 10 lists by simply offering a collection of 50 of the many wonderful things I read, watched or heard in 2016. (Here’s last year’s list, for reference.) Standard caveats: I don’t watch everything! I am behind on many things. That’s just the way the world is. So if something you loved isn’t here, it is not a rebuke. And: these are cultural  —   mostly    —   things. These are not the best things in the world. Like yours, my actual list of wonderful things from the year, if I wrote it in a journal instead of for work, would be a list of people and moments spent with them, of days when it was unexpectedly sunny and of the times when things suddenly felt better. But whatever journey you’re on at any given moment, you can always use more good things. So here we go. 1. The willfully  —   gleefully  —   stupid jokes of Angie Tribeca, the TBS comedy starring Rashida Jones that reminded me of Airplane! in a wonderful way that very few things do. Vive le prosthetic tongue! 2. The moment in Captain America: Civil War when a bunch of characters sit around and discuss, with seriousness, a moral dilemma. For a surprisingly long time! Searching conversations in which multiple basically good characters have very different things to say and are allowed to say them and mean them are not all that common in summer blockbusters, and this one was welcome. 3. Leslie Odom, Jr. telling the story of how he watched Shonda Rhimes yell at Art Garfunkel. It’s what   talk shows are for, and it made me instantly envious of everyone who got to see it in person. 4. All of John Mulaney’s comedy special, available on Netflix, called The Comeback Kid  —   and from a strictly shallow perspective, John Mulaney’s tremendous blue suit. Sue me, I’m a lady who likes a great . .. suit. 5. Mike Birbiglia’s sensitive, funny, sad, honest film Don’t Think Twice, which has more affection for and understanding of a certain kind of comedy person than perhaps any piece of fiction that’s ever been written about them. It’s got a killer cast including   Key, Gillian Jacobs, and Birbiglia himself, and it got some of the best reviews of the year  —   deservedly so. (And an R rating, by the way, which is dumb as rocks and completely unnecessary. You’d be much, much better with your teenager seeing this film than some   slaughterfest with abundant death but invisible blood. Boo, ratings.) 6. The finale of the most recent season of the beloved series The Great British  . As I’ve written at length, it’s a thoughtful and uplifting franchise  —   really!  —   and the most recent finale (which we Americans did indeed get in 2016) was as richly satisfying as a good slice of cake. 7. The most recent season of HBO’s Veep. I don’t want to spoil it, but while the show has always been sharp and hilarious, its unexpected and byzantine plotting (in both the    sense and the    sense) got utterly bazoo but somehow remained believable within the world the writers and performers have built. 8. Anna Kendrick and Stephen Colbert singing ”They Say That Falling In Love Is Wonderful.” This is also what   talk shows are for. 9. Christian Siriano, fashion provocateur  —   in the best way. Siriano has grown from a bit of a pain in the behind when he won Project Runway to a very interesting designer and a fascinating guy to listen to. He got a lot of attention for dressing Leslie Jones for the Ghostbusters premiere, but he wound up dressing eight women for the Emmy Awards, and they represented quite a mix of sizes, races and ages. They all looked very different, and they all looked right. Siriano believes in his own vision and always has, but he also seems to believe that the purpose of women’s fashion is to serve women, not that the purpose of women is to serve women’s fashion. Good on you, CS. 10. Speaking of Ghostbusters, Kate McKinnon’s Jillian Holtzmann was one of the weirdest, greatest characters of this year and most other years, and her work on Saturday Night Live as Hillary Clinton was surprising and touching. SNL is often plagued by its institutional standing and a certain cultural (not political) conservatism, and the fact that some of what McKinnon did as Clinton was so weird as comedy  —   even if you didn’t think it always worked  —   is one of the most encouraging signs that the show remains alive. 11. Titus Burgess on WNYC’s Death, Sex  Money. The discussion he had with host Anna Sale is one of the most candid, peaceful, wise conversations I can remember from any corner of public radio, and I recommend it to everyone, always. 12. ”Grandma’s Teenage Diaries,” an entry by David Rees in the New York Times Magazine’s ”Letter Of Recommendation” feature. Rees discovered some of his grandmother’s early writings, and the way he describes them is warm and lovely, but more than anything, it sheds light on the way so many of us think of our older relatives as having always been calm and settled, when in fact, they often led wild, adventurous, exciting lives all their own that we simply never saw. 13. Kristin Chirico’s BuzzFeed piece about visiting the bridal salon where Say Yes To The Dress is filmed. It doesn’t go the way she expects, and I won’t spoil it more than that. Chirico is one of my favorite writers for all sorts of reasons, and her willingness to be surprised by her own experiences is one of the big ones. 14. The Indigo Girls story in Dave Holmes’ memoir Party Of One. I enjoyed this book so much that the second time I read it, I lost all track of time and got my first bad sunburn in years. True story!  : Dave’s tweetstorm about phone scammers. 15. The anniversary celebration of All Songs Considered where I saw Glen Hansard break a guitar string with the force of his   which he does kind of a lot. 16. The frustrating and enlightening ”Object Anyway” episode of the podcast More Perfect. Officially about jury selection, it winds up being about the complex ways people think about race and crime. It’s great radio, and very educational, and constantly compelling. Bonus: I also love the episode ”The Imperfect Plaintiffs.” 17. ”I got this.” The U. S. women’s gymnastics team cleaned up at the Rio Olympics, but perhaps nothing thrilled me more than Laurie Hernandez, just before her beam routine, being caught on camera saying to herself, ”I got this.” 18. Take My Wife, Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher’s comedy series on the   Seeso network. It would have been a terrific show about a complex couple even if it weren’t the regrettably rare depiction of lesbians who, as one episode points out, don’t die immediately when they have sex. 19. W. Kamau Bell’s United Shades Of America, the bracing and funny travelogue series about race and culture that seems even more needed now, as it prepares for a second season on CNN, than it did when it first aired. 20. The    musical Sing Street, which seems to be about a kid who starts a band, but which also turns out to be about the bonds of friendship, the perils of romance and especially the crucial role of siblinghood for anyone who’s ever felt like they don’t quite know how to bloom in quite the place where they were first planted. 21. The year Sterling K. Brown had on both FX’s The People v. O. J. Simpson and NBC’s This Is Us. Both are shows with large casts, and no one in either group was more critical or better than he was. It’s really rare for the same actor to do such good work on both a prestige cable miniseries and a traditional broadcast drama, and Brown more than pulled it off. Absolutely my dramatic acting MVP of 2016. 22. Samantha Bee’s acceptance of the award for Outstanding Achievement In News And Information from the Television Critics Association for her TBS show Full Frontal. She spoke about the show and how grateful she was, then added, ”Now I’ll take your questions on how I achieve   balance.” Like much of what she did through the year, the line was direct, funny, and cutting. So maybe don’t always ask women about   balance, because it appears that they do notice. 23. Michelle Obama’s Carpool Karaoke segment with James Corden, which took a bit that was (and is) rapidly reaching overexposure and immediately made it surprising and joyful, particularly when you include the cameo appearance in the back seat. 24. Sunny Pawar in the drama Lion. Dev Patel is terrific as the adult Saroo, but before he can play a man who looks for his biological family, Pawar has to hold up a good part of the film as a very little boy who loses contact with his. In a pretty good year for kid acting, Pawar was one of my favorite discoveries. 25. ”Unbreakable.” Not everything worked in the revival of Gilmore Girls, but the performance by Sutton Foster of an original song by Jeanine Tesori and show creator Amy   was an unexpected surprise that broke the format but did its job with great force. I was surprised to learn it was written for this, because it’s the kind of song you instantly feel like you’ve heard before, not in the sense of cliche but in the sense of warm familiarity. 26. The ending  —   perhaps too neat, but come on, that’s kind of the format  —   of the   Downton Abbey. It didn’t precisely scratch my every itch (I don’t personally believe Downton ever quite recovered from the loss of Dan Stevens) but did give me some of the things I wanted most, and did deliver a solid dose of Matthew Goode, perhaps the most Downton man who took quite that long to be on Downton. 27. Weiner, hoo boy. There is much, especially in retrospect, that is   about this documentary, which chronicles Anthony Weiner’s failed 2013 run for Mayor of New York City two years after he resigned from Congress following a sexting scandal. If you see this movie with, say, five friends, I can almost guarantee you that you will have a series of conversations about it in which the running theme is, ”I just do not get it.” There is one sequence that involves Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin, just . .. pacing, that may be the most interesting thing I saw in a documentary all year. 28. Minnie Driver’s funny, singular performance as the mother to three kids including a special needs son on ABC’s Speechless, a show that has avoided about eight different potential pitfalls to become one of the best broadcast comedies on TV. Driver has needed and deserved a role just like this for years, at least as far back as her hilarious guest spots on Will  Grace, and it was a delight to see her find it. (Bonus: the rest of the cast is just as strong it’s a really solid group and the show is a fine addition to ABC’s strong family comedy lineup.) 29. ”Hello?” I’m convinced that no one who really knows and likes PJ Vogt and Alex Goldman, the hosts of Gimlet’s Reply All podcast, would think it was a good idea for them to take phone calls from anyone and everyone for 48 hours straight. And it was not a good idea. It was a terrible idea, and their bizarre apparent fantasy of going without sleep (? ?) for days (? ??) while talking to strangers (? ???) on tape (? ???? !) quickly fell apart, as it should have. But what ultimately came of it was a nearly   episode that contains, particularly as it progresses, moments of real grace and surprise. 30. Nothing I saw this year was more unexpectedly weird than watching the real Grandmaster Flash try to explain his art to a bunch of television critics during a preview of Netflix’s The Get Down (in which Grandmaster Flash is a character) at the Television Critics Association summer press tour. We were overmatched by what amounted to Grandmaster Flash’s TED talk, and I’m not afraid to say so. Meanwhile, The Get Down was a little bit all over the place, but the central performance from Justice Smith was a real pleasure. The show has half of its first season yet to come, and for Smith, at least, I’ll watch it. 31. Ryan Gosling leaning on a lamppost in La La Land. It pushed a button that’s been deeply programmed inside me since I saw Singin’ In The Rain, and I found it utterly delightful. The movie isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but it was my entire pot thereof. 32. Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. One of the real travesties of this year was that this music mockumentary from the Lonely Island somehow slipped past people. Already, it’s got a reputation as a film much better than its   flopsitude would suggest, and I firmly believe that as years pass, those of us who truly appreciated it will be vindicated. Please see it just for the   songs and the celebrity cameos. 33. The second season of Catastrophe, starring Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan  —   with Carrie Fisher. It started with a time jump that was clever and wise and instantly moved the story to a more interesting phase of their relationship to explore than you would have seen had the second season picked up right where the first left off. That kind of experimentation is always welcome in episodic comedy, where it’s so easy to box yourself into a corner with such matters as . .. new babies. 34. Little’s bath. While there are a lot of things about Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight to celebrate, I’ll just choose an early sequence in which Little (Alex R. Hibbert) carefully heats a pot of water on the stove. It’s a beautiful little peek at his routine  —   at his independence, resilience and loneliness, all of which will recur through what we see of his life, all at once. 35. The youngest tier of performers in Stranger Things  —   Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Caleb McLaughlin, and Gaten Matarazzo. They were asked, in essence, to embody archetypes from a period they never lived through: the Steven   King ’80s, when kids roamed on bikes and discovered oddities with their best friends. Nevertheless, they all came through like champs, and while the show had trouble delivering on all of its promises (as supernatural stories often do) the friendships sustained it throughout. 36. Sailor dances. I am overlapping as little as possible with Glen Weldon’s Pop Culture Advent Calendar (which offers 25 more good things from this year) but I, too, would be remiss if I didn’t mention Channing Tatum’s ”No Dames” number from Hail, Caesar! For musical aficionados, the callbacks to sailor movies, tap numbers and even Rodgers and Hammerstein (the song is a   in places from ”There Is Nothing Like A Dame”) are a special treat, and Tatum can dance on my screen any time, for as long as he likes. I’m still not sure that guy has been used to the absolute height of his powers. I fear what could happen (to me) when he is. 37. Issa and Molly. There are lots of shows about friends, but not that many good shows about friends. Issa Rae’s Insecure on HBO was many wonderful things at once (I could easily have chosen the early sequence in which Issa talks to herself in the mirror, which has been rightly praised by many before me) but I treasured nothing about it more than I did the portrayal of Issa and her best friend, Molly. Their bond is their primary emotional entanglement in many ways, and therefore it’s the relationship that often has the highest stakes. 38. Michael Shannon in Loving, the story of Richard and Mildred Loving (Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga) whose Supreme Court case established that it was unconstitutional for states to ban interracial marriage. The leads in the film are absolutely divine, and Nick Kroll does good and unexpected work as their attorney. But I was also a sucker for a brief appearance by Shannon as Grey Villet, the Life photographer who took the most   portraits of the Lovings while their case was pending. (Take a look at the real photos, if you never have.) 39. As if it’s not enough that Mamoudou Athie played Grandmaster Flash in The Get Down, he was also a very dreamy romantic lead in a little movie called Jean Of The Joneses, from   Stella Meghie, which follows a young woman (Taylour Paige) with a sprawling matriarchal Brooklyn family. It premiered on TV One in October, and while I don’t think you can stream it right now, it’ll show up, and it will be well worth seeking out. 40. HBO’s documentary Suited, about a Brooklyn custom suiting shop that caters to transgender, nonbinary, and gender   customers. It’s about identity and fashion and compassion, and it was one of this year’s best. 41. Ezra Edelman’s O. J.: Made In America. As good as the FX drama series of the Simpson trial was, I think Edelman’s documentary was even better  —   more stirring, more focused on the social aspects of the case, more searching. It makes the point over and over that what’s most beneficial isn’t to know more about the court case itself, but to understand the many ways in which the case, both as a series of events and as a cultural phenomenon, was created by the country where it happened. 42. Josh Gondelman’s comedy album Physical Whisper includes a track called ”Kiss Me Neck,” and in it, you’ll find one of the reasons Josh (who’s a pal and a writer for Last Week Tonight With John Oliver) is the kind of comedian he is: it’s long and involved, and then . .. the punch line doesn’t come from him. It’s somebody else’s laugh, and telling the story comes from a place of generosity. That would make it unusual in a lot of people’s repertoire, but it fits right in on this record. 43. I am   obsessed with the musical The Last Five Years, and I had no worse FOMO this year than what I experienced when I missed Cynthia Erivo and Joshua Henry performing it at Town Hall in New York. Fortunately, there’s video evidence. This kind of   theater experience, which is sort of a relative of the production of Company a couple of years ago with Neil Patrick Harris and Stephen Colbert, is something I could stand to see a lot more of, hopefully when I’m not traveling. 44. The Brooklyn   episode ”9 Days,” in which both Jake (Andy Samberg) and Holt (Andre Braugher) got the mumps  —   and were quarantined together, and named their goiters  —   was goofy and perfect. Brooklyn is a show I’m crazy about, but never more than when they lock up Jake and Holt and just make them bump into each other in a variety of ways. 45. Emma Thompson being really just about perfect. Much of Bridget Jones’s Baby was just a nostalgia tour for    —   and there’s nothing wrong with that, really. But Emma Thompson shows up in a few scenes as Bridget’s   and she is so funny that it makes the entire film a great bargain, just for that. (”My husband said it was like watching his favorite pub burn down.” A line delivery so good I   in my living room.) 46. This fall’s fresh Emmy winners: Rami Malek for Mr. Robot, Tatiana Maslany for Orphan Black, and Louie Anderson in Baskets, Courtney B. Vance and Sarah Paulson and Sterling K. Brown for The People v. O. J. Simpson, among others, gave hope to those who would like to see the Emmys get a little more . .. well, creative in recognizing talent. Sometimes it feels like it’s all the same faces every year, and this year, it wasn’t. The rare awards show where the winners themselves were fairly frequently exciting to see. 47. All the moments in which, even while grieving, we shared thoughts about artists who died this year. While no one can feel happy, really, about losses like Prince and David Bowie and George Michael and Carrie Fisher, there is a way in which sadness frees up vulnerable thoughts, and I’m not sure we’ve ever had a better year for memorial essays and other reminders to appreciate the artists you love as loudly and unreservedly as you can. To wit: I could easily have made one of the items on this list my firm belief that nobody wrote better more consistently this year in more different ways than Rembert Browne here’s his remembrance of Phife Dawg, and here he is on George Michael’s ”Freedom ’90.” 48. Inside the NPR family, one of my favorite podcast episodes of the year was Code Switch’s ”Audie And The    School Bus.” Just listen. (Bonus in this category: My Pop Culture Happy Hour   and dear friend Glen Weldon’s great, great book The Caped Crusade: Batman And The Rise Of Nerd Culture. Pro tip  —   consider the audiobook.) 49. This was my year of Hamilton, as it was for many people. Not only did that mean I had the chance to see the show, but it meant I got to watch the #shotsoutthegrammy phenomenon on Snapchat, and I got to watch a digital puppeteer for PBS’s Splash  Bubbles make a fish lip sync ”My Shot,” and it meant I got to hear Code Switch’s Gene Demby talk to George Washington himself, Chris Jackson. (By the way: I don’t love everything on the Hamilton mixtape, but I do love Dessa singing ”Congratulations. ”) Big year. 50. I don’t think it would be fair not to acknowledge that all the wonderful things there are often coexist with tremendous sadness and disappointment and fear. In that spirit, I want to close the list with Gregory Porter’s Tiny Desk Concert, which he played at NPR just after we learned that NPR photographer David Gilkey and journalist and interpreter Zabihullah Tamanna had died in Afghanistan. There had been so much crying that day that half the eyes in the building were still swollen. Porter came to us by chance, but it was just as if he’d been sent for this purpose. The concert was sorely needed and incredibly healing. And yes, it was wonderful."
"For those of us at NPR, 2016 was   of big news stories, so much so, it sometimes seemed the horrors in the headlines would never stop  —   the migrant crisis, police shootings, terrorist attacks, and on and on. But when we looked at stories that you, our NPR One listeners, loved listening to the most in 2016, it painted a very different picture of the year. The   stories in NPR One indicate that you are passionate about three subjects. First, you love science and innovation. You really love the National Park Service for its 100th birthday, NPR produced a series of stories throughout the year that captured your attention. And you also enjoyed our longer,   discussions with artists such as Miguel and Dua Lipa, who talked about their creative processes. Oh, and you also love stories about Finnish mail carriers. (More on that later.) First, a little bit about how we came up with this list. Our NPR One app allows you to customize your NPR experience, by skipping ahead to the stories you like or to your favorite podcasts. When you listen to a story instead of skipping it and either share that story or tap on that story’s light bulb icon (it’s our version of the ”like” button) it’s a pretty good indicator you enjoyed or appreciated that story. These are the 10 stories that had the most of these positive interactions. 1. Just Like Human Skin, This Plastic Sheet Can Sense And Heal, Joe Palca took us to a lab to meet a scientist who is trying to make artificial skin out of plastic that can feel things, heal itself and keep germs out. Zhenan Bao has a long way to go before testing the plastic skin on humans, but she’s making progress. Listen, Read,  2. Planet Money  —   NPR One Oil Exclusive, In an NPR One exclusive, the Planet Money team explained how crude oil becomes more than just the fuel that powers our cars and heats our homes. It’s now the basis for many other consumer products, including the dyes that color our clothes and even painkillers that cure our headaches. Listen,  3. Noteworthy: Miguel, In this piece from NPR Music’s Noteworthy documentary series, host Jason King visited psychedelic soul artist Miguel in his Los Angeles home and spoke with him in the studio where he’s working on songs for an upcoming fourth album. This is a deep, immersive listen into the world of creating music. Watch, Listen,  4. Don’t Care About National Parks? The Park Service Needs You To, The National Park Service has been a part of our country for 100 years. But Nathan Rott reports about concerns that the majority of the visitors to National Parks are white and don’t reflect the demographics of the country. He looks at some attempts to change that with new programs and efforts toward diversifying the park’s staff and visitors. Listen, Read,  5. Indian Automaker Balances Luxury With Global Sustainability, Sonari Glinton, Ari Shapiro and Susan Stamberg put a Jaguar sports car through its paces in the hills of Los Angeles. An Indian company called Tata now owns Jaguar, and it’s trying to find new approaches to limit pollution and energy consumption. Listen,  6. Finland’s Postal Service Will Mow Your Lawn, Postal service workers in Finland have long helped out the elderly by delivering food and assisting with small things around the house, but now mail carriers are available to mow lawns. Listen,  7. Noteworthy: Dua Lipa, Noteworthy host Jason King met Dua Lipa in New York the morning before her Tonight Show performance for the latest episode in the NPR Music documentary series. They spoke about how she developed her sound, why she has always wanted to be a pop star, and why breaking through in the United States is so important to her. Listen, Watch,  8. National Park Service Celebrates Its 100th Anniversary, Nathan Rott introduces us to the people behind the scenes who keep the National Parks running. Listen,  9. Blockchain Looks To Change How To Do Business Online, Blockchain is a technology that allows people to share what is basically a digital ledger. It is best known as the code that makes Bitcoin work. Don Tapscott wrote a book about blockchain and says it is the greatest innovation in computer science in years. Listen,  10. Keeping Bears Wild  —   Or Trying  —   At National Parks, There are wildlife biologists who try to keep bears in National Parks wild and away from people. We learn about the problems of ”bear jams” and ”bear selfies” and meet the people who try to   the bears that get too attached to life near people.

"Though many of us lamented the   saga of this year’s U. S. presidential election, the news was too momentous to tune out. Indeed, many of the year’s biggest stories on NPR. org were all about politics. The top 20 most popular stories from the past year ranged from fact checks to mosquito bites, from Aleppo to taxes, and how to raise kids who will thrive, whatever the future brings. Here they are: the   stories from a year we won’t soon forget. Here Is What Donald Trump Wants To Do In His First 100 Days, The top story of the year  —   and in fact, the top story of all time on NPR. org, with more than 17 million views  —   was one that we didn’t write. It’s a memo from   Donald Trump, released in October, setting his agenda for his first 100 days in office. FACT CHECK: Donald Trump’s First 100 Days Action Plan, NPR’s reporters and editors took a deep dive into that plan for the first 100 days: How much of his proposed agenda can   Trump really pull off? They assessed what it would take, for instance, to eliminate two federal regulations for each new regulation that’s added, as Trump said he wants to do. Who Benefits From Donald Trump’s Tax Plan? Trump promised to ”massively cut taxes for the middle class, the forgotten people, the forgotten men and women of this country, who built our country.” During a town hall meeting on NBC’s Today, he said he believes in raising taxes on the wealthy. But some economists say Trump’s tax plan would benefit the 1 percent the most. Fact Check: Trump And Clinton Debate For The First Time, Though some have claimed we’re now in the ”  era,” NPR. org readers aren’t buying it. Our live fact check of the first debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton drew nearly 10 million page views, becoming what was at that point our most viewed story ever. FACT CHECK: Clinton And Trump Debate For The 2nd Time, The second debate was a testy one, and our political team assessed the accuracy of the candidates’ statements on everything from the deficit and the Affordable Care Act to Trump’s comments about women and Clinton’s email server. Fact Check And Full Transcript Of The Final 2016 Presidential Debate, This was the debate that added the terms ”bad hombre” and ”nasty woman” to our lexicon. NPR’s political team dug into the   of the candidates’ statements about guns, abortion, immigration and more. Shades Of 2000? Clinton Surpasses Trump In Popular Vote Tally, As the final votes were tallied, Clinton became the fifth U. S. presidential candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. The structure of the Electoral College makes it theoretically possible for a candidate to win the White House with less than 30 percent of the popular vote. Live Coverage: Election Night 2016, Then there was election night itself. Trump’s victory caught many by surprise, and our live blog tracked the triumphs and tears as results emerged in contests around the country. Donald Trump Might Be In Real Trouble This Time, After the Republican Convention in July, Trump’s poll numbers went into a slump. NPR’s Ron Elving delved into the factors that were hampering Trump at the time. A Wounded Child In Aleppo, Silent And Still, Shocks The World, The image of one child, wounded and bleeding from the head, became a symbol of the Syrian conflict’s brutality, with airstrikes that often targeted hospitals. For 70 Years, A Mug In Auschwitz Held A Secret Treasure, In a mug belonging to Jews sent to the concentration camp at Auschwitz, museum conservators discovered a false bottom, concealing a gold necklace and a gold ring inlaid with stones. The jewelry had remained hidden all these years. What’s The Best Way To Keep Mosquitoes From Biting? The best way to avoid the Zika virus is to not get bitten by mosquitoes in the first place. NPR talked to researchers  —   many of whom spend a lot of time in   jungles and marshes  —   about the pros and cons of repellents including DEET, lemon eucalyptus and good   long sleeves. One scientist adds this fashion tip: Tuck your pants into your socks. Attention, Students: Put Your Laptops Away, With the advent of laptops and tablets, many students started typing notes, because it’s often faster than writing. But it turns out that the slowness of taking notes by hand is what helps students process information and actually understand the concepts they’re writing down. How To Raise Brilliant Children, According To Science, Two developmental psychologists offer a new framework to help parents cultivate the skills their children will actually need to thrive in the world: ”If we don’t rear children who are comfortable taking risks, we won’t have successes.” Groundhog Day: Punxsutawney Phil Did Not See His Shadow, It might have been the chilly weather that day or just a love for Bill Murray movies, but readers needed to know the latest   meteorology. Phil’s verdict: Winter was on its last legs. WATCH:   Nails Impersonations Of Trump, Clinton, Obama, Sanders, From the depths of an exhausting election, a bit of mirth emerged in the form of Jack Aiello,   graduation speaker extraordinaire. What would the candidates say about the cinnamon rolls at Thomas Middle School? You’ll have to watch the video. Suspect Purchased Guns Legally Ahead Of Deadliest Shooting In Modern U. S. History, In June, a gunman opened fire on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. killing at least 50 people before he was shot dead by police. The suspect, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to ISIS in a 911 call before the attack. Mateen legally purchased a long gun and a handgun in the days before the attack. Minnesota Gov. Calls Traffic Stop Shooting ’Absolutely Appalling At All Levels’ Philando Castile, a    black man, was fatally shot by a police officer in suburban St. Paul, Minn. in July. Castile had notified the officer that he was licensed to carry a handgun and was reaching for his wallet at the officer’s request when he was shot. His death, streamed live on Facebook by his girlfriend, sparked national outrage. Gwen Ifill, Host Of ’Washington Week’ And ’PBS NewsHour,’ Dies, Gwen Ifill, one of the most prominent political journalists in the country, died in November. ”I’m very keen about the fact that a little girl now, watching the news, when they see me and Judy [Woodruff] sitting side by side, it will occur to them that that’s perfectly normal  —   that it won’t seem like any big breakthrough at all,” Ifill said in a 2013 interview. In Victory For Protesters, Army Halts Construction Of Dakota Pipeline, In December, the Army Corps of Engineers denied a permit for the construction of a key section of the Dakota Access Pipeline, to the cheers of protesters who had built a sprawling camp that was then covered in snow. That decision essentially halted construction of the   oil pipeline, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation."
"With so much attention paid to   women in 2016, from Hillary Clinton to Wonder Woman, it’s easy to lose sight of   women who are blazing a trail in   and   countries. In ways big and small, these women have moved the needle on gender equality by being activists, role models or simply taking a stand. Here’s a roundup of some of the many memorable women we profiled on Goats and Soda in 2016. Halima Aden, the beauty pageant contestant who wore a burkini  The      wanted to compete for Miss Minnesota USA and didn’t let the fact that she is a hijabi  —   a Muslim woman who wears hijab  —   stop her. In the swimsuit portion of the competition, she wore a burkini, a type of modest swimwear specially made for hijabis. She grabbed headlines for her confidence, from the States to Somalia. ”Beauty isn’t   ” she says. ”If I can find different ways to spread that message, I will.” Sitawa Wafula, founder of Kenya’s first mental health hotline  Wafula has bipolar disorder, but she had a hard time getting diagnosed in her native Kenya. Some people thought she was cursed  —   and even worse, there just weren’t many mental health facilities in Kenya where she could get good information about her condition or medications. So she established Kenya’s first text message mental health hotline so anyone in the country could send in questions to trained volunteers. She’s become a role model in Kenya  —   and this year, named one of her country’s 40 women under 40. Shahd   a mom who slammed a teacher who shamed her daughter, When Swerki’s    daughter stripped nude in front of some boys in preschool, the teacher was frantic, acting as if the girl had ruined her future. At first, Swerki was filled with panic and shame. But she was determined to raise her daughter to be comfortable with her own body  —   an awareness she herself wasn’t taught as a young Palestinian girl. ”I will never allow anyone to control my reactions and feelings toward any incident happening to my daughter. To my husband. To me. To my life,” she says. Jacqueline de Chollet, a Swiss aristocrat who tackles child marriage, What was supposed to be a vacation to northern India ended up changing her life  —   and the lives of almost 200 child brides and other girls. After a chance encounter with a woman in a remote village, de Chollet, the daughter of a Swiss baron, was inspired to start a school for girls in Jodhpur. Called the Veerni Institute, the school requires parents to sign a contract stating that they won’t send their daughter to live with her husband until the girl graduates from high school. In exchange, the girl gets free room, board and education. Petrona Choc Cuc, a victim of sexual violence who testified against her abusers  It happened during Guatemala’s civil war in the 1980s, but Choc Cuc hadn’t forgotten. This year, the    Mayan Indian went to court and told a   judge how soldiers killed her husband, captured her and her daughter, and repeatedly raped her. Many women were too scared to come to court, but not Choc Cuc. Her testimony was critical. In February, two military officials were sentenced to over 100 years of prison each for their war crimes. Rita Superman, a police chief who fights human trafficking, Superman has found that sometimes a   conversation is all it takes to turn a victim’s life around. She shares the story of Sylvia, from Bulgaria, who was arrested in Cyprus for prostitution. Superman asked her: Do you like what you’re doing? Are you satisfied with your work? No one had ever asked Sylvia those questions before. Sylvia was inspired to go to a shelter and press charges against her captor. It’s moments like these that moved the U. S. State Department to honor Superman this year for her activism against human trafficking. Neetu, child bride turned   wrestler  She was a child bride. Today, she’s a   wrestler eyeing the 2020 Olympics. Neetu, a   athlete, an occasional Bollywood actor and a mom of two, is seen as an inspiration in India. ”She’s changed everything,” says a woman from her village. ”Everybody believes that a girl can now say  —   ’I want to do something.’ ”"
"As the 115th Congress is sworn in Tuesday, Republicans will be poised to control Washington with a stronger hand than they have in a decade  —   with the Senate, House and the White House in GOP control once   Donald Trump takes office on January 20. This past November, Republicans held their congressional losses to a minimum, helped by an unexpectedly strong GOP wave behind Trump. After losing just two Senate seats, they’ll hold a   edge (two independents caucus with Democrats). In the House, Republicans lost six seats, giving them a   majority. House Speaker Paul Ryan boasted shortly after Election Day that the ”new unified Republican government” would be ”focused on turning   Trump’s victory into real progress for the American people.” And as NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis explained, there is precedent for a unified government pushing through sweeping changes early on: ”When the White House and Congress have been controlled by the same party, Washington has produced some of the most sweeping  —   albeit politically polarizing  —   legislation aimed at shifting the political trajectory of the nation toward the cause of the party in power. ”In particular, the first   congressional session of a new administration  —   when public approval is generally at its highest for the incoming president  —   has produced some recent presidents’ most memorable legislative imprints.” GOP congressional leaders and Trump agree on many things  —   paramount among them their best chance ever to repeal and replace Obamacare, in addition to rolling back federal regulations and increasing infrastructure projects. But there are some looming showdowns between the incoming president and members of his own party on Capitol Hill  —   many of whom were less than supportive of Trump in the primaries and lukewarm on his prospects in the general election. Top Republicans have already signaled their break with Trump over alleged Russian cyberattacks intended to interfere with the U. S. elections. After President Obama announced sweeping sanctions against the country last week, Ryan called the response ”overdue” but ”appropriate.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the sanctions were a ”a good initial step” and reiterated his support for a congressional investigation into the supposed interference. Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain is planning a hearing for Thursday into the breach, with three top intelligence officials set to testify. Trump, however, has said the country should ”move on” from the cyberattacks. During the campaign he repeatedly praised Russia and its president Vladimir Putin, casting doubt that they were behind the intrusion. He even praised Putin as ”very smart!” after his muted response to sanctions from the Obama administration. Trump has, however, agreed to meet with U. S. intelligence officials regarding the cyber breaches this week. Congress is prepared to get a jump start on confirming Trump’s Cabinet nominees as well, with hearings on some top appointees beginning next week. But many of his most important picks are controversial, particularly Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson. The Exxon Mobil CEO’s ties to Russia and Putin have already raised concern, and he’s sure to be pressed about the new sanctions as well. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions’s nomination for attorney general could be contentious too. While sitting members typically receive deference from their peers, Democrats will draw attention to his past failure to get confirmation as a federal judge because of alleged racist remarks made in the past. Another looming fight will be when Trump makes his pick for the Supreme Court to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia. President Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland languished last year as Republicans declined to take up his nomination. The process of repealing the Affordable Care Act is expected to get started this week as the Senate is expected to take up a budget measure that would begin the process of dismantling President Obama’s signature domestic achievement. But it won’t come quickly. Without a replacement plan on the table, some Republicans are wary of moving too quickly to dismantle the healthcare law for fear it would roil insurance markets if no fix is ready to be implemented. Soon after the members of the 115th Congress are sworn in on Tuesday, their next task will be to officially   Ryan as speaker. And while there’s little drama expected, there could still be defections once the voice vote is held on the House floor, particularly from hardline Trump supporters. Two years ago,   John Boehner had 25 members of his own party vote against him. When Boehner stepped down in October 2015, only nine other Republicans voted for someone other than Ryan. Ryan distanced himself from Trump just before Election Day after damaging audio emerged of Trump bragging about groping women. The two have since reconciled, but there have been signs of discord among the base. At a rally last month in Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin, the speaker was booed. And while Trump quieted the dissenters, he did caution that if Ryan ever opposed him their relationship might not be so rosy any longer. ”Honestly, he’s like a fine wine: Every day goes by, I get to appreciate his genius more and more,” Trump told the Wisconsin crowd on Dec. 13. ”Now, if he ever goes against me, I’m not going to say that, OK?” It may have been a joke, but speaks to the strain in the most powerful relationship in Washington."
"Democrats may have lost the House and the Senate over the past eight years, but they always had one thing: President Barack Obama  —   and his veto pen  —   in the White House. That won’t be the case next year, when Republicans find themselves with all the power in Washington for the first time since 2006. The capitol’s new power dynamic  —   and the aggressive agenda Republican leaders are laying out for 2017 —   is forcing Democrats to make some tough strategic choices about how they’ll work as a minority party. The starting point in the conversation Democrats are having with themselves right now is this: Republicans in Congress spent almost all of the past eight years opposing President Obama, and they seem to have reaped a lot of political rewards for the block opposition. GOP leaders will get to set the agenda in Congress next year. And among their first orders of business will be voting on a Supreme Court nominee picked by President Donald Trump. That’s after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected any hearings, let alone votes, for Obama’s pick, Merrick Garland. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is quick and careful to reject an approach of wholesale opposition, though. She recently described Democrats’ approach as ”always trying to find a place where we can find a common goal. Giving [Republicans] credit, or saving face, whatever it happens to be.” ”We would be hopeful that there are some places that we can work together,” Pelosi said. But when Pelosi and other Democrats talk about working with Trump, that common goal is conditional. They say Trump would have to be willing to do things they care about  —   like, perhaps, following through on a promise to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure projects. ”We think it should be large. He’s mentioned a trillion dollars. I told him that sounds good to me,” incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer recently told ABC News. Highlighting differences, But otherwise, Democrats are confident that drawing out their differences with the new president will be a winning strategy. ”Our big leverage is the public,” Pelosi said, expressing confidence that public opinion sides with Democrats when it comes to issues like not making major changes to Medicare and Social Security. Democrats are eager to draw the contrast on those sorts of topics, and see those particular wedge issues as a big reason why they won back the House and Senate in 2006, the last time Republicans held so much power in Washington. That’s why, while Republicans like McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan are focusing on repealing Obamacare, Pelosi, Schumer, and other Democrats keep talking about the possibility of wholesale Medicare changes. ”Republicans here in Washington are gearing up for a war on seniors,” Schumer warned at a recent Washington press conference with a ”hands off our Medicare” message. Schumer said Senate Democrats will give ”one heck of a hearing” to Rep. Tom Price, Trump’s pick for the Department of Health and Human Services and a longtime Medicare critic. Democrats think they can generate a lot of positive headlines by grilling Trump’s cabinet picks. ”These are, with a few exceptions, radical nominees, the likes of which we have never seen in this country,” said Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut. Democrats see hearings as a way to continue emphasizing their key concerns about Trump, like the fact he never released his tax returns, and the ongoing question of how he’ll avoid    problems as president. They see Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson’s hearing as an avenue to highlight Russia’s attempt to disrupt the presidential race, and Trump’s warm words toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. A big choice on Obamacare, But highlighting contrasts can only go so far, when Republicans set the Congressional agenda. At some point, Democrats still face a choice. Do they do their best to block every single big initiative, or try to work with Republicans to make it more  ? Sarah Binder studies Congress at the Brookings Institution, and said Democrats do have leverage. ”On most measures, whether it’s spending bills, deregulation, repeal  . That all requires cooperation from at least eight Democrats.” That’s because while Republicans will control the Senate with 52 seats, they’ll need at least 60 votes to advance bills in the chamber. The hardest political calculus could be Obamacare. Republicans can repeal the landmark law without any Democratic votes, using the budget reconciliation process that helped pass the initial law. But they’d need Democratic support in the Senate to pass a replacement plan, since the measure would be subject to filibuster. Blocking any sort of replacement plan, and then trying to lay the blame for disappearing health care coverage on Trump and Republicans, would be a bold, if callous, political move. ”Are they kind of, as a party, constitutionally adverse to that type of strategy? Many people think so,” said Binder. ”That they just value government and legislative action too much to do that to the process.” Indeed, many Democrats might want to work with Republicans to keep as much of Obamacare as they can. But helping give Trump a big legislative accomplishment could make him more popular. And it could anger progressive activists. ”It is the responsibility of this minority of Democrats in Congress to block, obstruct, disrupt, and do whatever they can,” filmmaker Michael Moore recently argued on CNN. He issued a warning to Democrats who may consider cutting deals with Trump: ”In the same way that the Tea Party was there in 2009, myself and thousands like me are going to be at those town halls in the district in the spring. And we will primary these Democrats if they don’t do their job.” Warnings like that may be why leaders like Schumer are quick to qualify any talk about working with Trump on issues like infrastructure spending. ”When we oppose Trump on values, or if his presidency takes a dark, divisive turn, we’re going to do it  ” he told ABC News. Pelosi knows Democrats all across the country are anxious. But she’s urging patience as the party tries to make its case to voters. ”Somebody used the analogy of, it’s like telling somebody they married the wrong person or their art is fake,” she recently told reporters. The first scenario is something many people have seen happen to a friend or family member. The second? Maybe not as much. Still, Pelosi’s point was that American voters did choose Trump and the GOP this year. ”They bought it. They’ll find out sooner or later whether they made a mistake,” she said, arguing that it’s better to let the married couple or art connoisseur make that discovery themselves, than to be told by an outside party. Pelosi has seen voters reject Democrats, come back to the party, and then reject them again. She said she is patient enough to point out the key differences between the parties, and wait for voters to eventually come back."
"There’s more methane gas in the atmosphere than there used to be, by every scientific measure. The Obama administration has been trying to stem the increase of this powerful greenhouse gas, but the incoming Trump administration appears bent on keeping the government’s hands off methane. The gas comes from agriculture, especially flooded agricultural lands like rice fields, as well as from the digestive tracts of livestock. But it’s also the main component of natural gas some methane escapes from leaky oil and gas operations. Whatever the source, scientists have found that, after many years of very little change, concentrations of methane in the atmosphere have increased by 3 percent over the past eight years. ”Methane concentrations in the atmosphere are surging faster than any time in the last 20 years,” environmental scientist Rob Jackson, of Stanford University, told NPR. Jackson and his colleagues have long tracked various sources of methane, as it emanates from oil and gas wells, city sewers and manure pits he recently published scientific papers on global as well as local concentrations of the gas. ”We understand some of the reason for (the increase),” he said, ”but not all of the reasons.” Other climate researchers have confirmed Jackson’s findings, and point out that methane warms the atmosphere at about 30 times the rate carbon dioxide does. Jackson said the recent increase convinces him that methane deserves as much, if not more, immediate attention as carbon dioxide, the main contributor to greenhouse gas. Scientists point to agriculture as the likeliest source of the new methane, especially in Asia and Africa. Feeding more people has meant more rice fields, more livestock and more manure  —   all sources of methane. There also is some evidence that small changes in the chemistry of the atmosphere may be allowing methane to stay aloft longer than usual, giving it more time to warm the air. But Jackson noted that there are other sources. ”We also see evidence for some increase from the fossil fuel sector,” he said, meaning drilling, processing and the transporting of natural gas. Recent research shows that leaks from the natural gas supply chain are more widespread than previously thought. The U. S. government is taking steps to stem that source of methane. The Environmental Protection Agency has written regulations to make companies plug methane leaks at new or modified oil and gas operations, and at the operations on some federal land. But the oil and gas industry believes the government is overreaching. That debate is likely to flare up when   Donald Trump takes office. Trump has said that environmental regulations drive up the cost of doing business and kill jobs his choice to head the EPA, Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, has made similar claims that the agency has a history of overly regulating oil and gas companies. Jack Gerard, who leads the American Petroleum Institute, told reporters in November that he wants the incoming Trump administration to dump the regulations. ”Methane (regulation) is a top priority, and we’ll be pursuing that aggressively,” Gerard said. Some oil and gas companies have already sued to stop the regulations, which aren’t yet in effect. ”I think everybody understands that there needs to be methane regulation, and it’s really a question of degree,” Steve Leifer, an environmental lawyer at Baker Botts, a legal firm that represents oil and gas companies, told NPR. ”I know the industry is very concerned. They are taking it very, very seriously.” Oil and gas representatives argue that the recent research shows that the biggest source of methane is agriculture, along with natural sources like wetlands. That may be true, but Mark Brownstein, a lawyer with the Environmental Defense Fund, said he believes that’s a red herring. ”I think the debate over what’s caused the   rise has served to obscure the fact that emissions are already too high,” Brownstein told NPR. You have to start somewhere, he said, and capturing leaked methane from oil and gas operations is easier than changing agriculture practices. In fact, stopping methane leaks should make economic sense for the oil and gas sector, he said: Methane is a commodity, and leaked methane is money lost. Brownstein’s organization, along with university researchers and natural gas companies, has studied how much gas is leaking. ”Let’s keep in mind what’s at stake here,” he said. ”We’re wasting enough natural gas every year to serve the needs of 7 million homes.” So far, oil and gas interests haven’t been convinced. Gerard points out that the industry is voluntarily reducing leaks and doesn’t need federal enforcement. Leifer, the attorney representing oil interests, told NPR the debate will likely end up in court, along with lots of other pending environmental regulations. ”There is no major rule that isn’t going to go to court,” he said. ”You just can’t find one.” That shouldn’t be surprising, he said. Every change of administration in Washington means more business for lawyers."
"A Jewish farming couple from Canada says it has shepherded the sheep of the bible back to the Holy Land after centuries in exile. With donations from Jewish and Christian supporters, and some help from the Israeli government, Jenna and Gil Lewinsky have airlifted 119 furry members of the Jacob Sheep breed from their farm in Abbotsford, British Columbia, to Israel. Jacob Sheep are found in the U. K. and North America, but the Lewinskys say the breed originally roamed the Middle East and ancient Israel, and their spotted and speckled coats match the description in the Book of Genesis of Jacob’s flock. ”You know that Israel is built on Jewish people returning. Now you have a case of an animal from the Old Testament also returning,” said Gil Lewinsky from a customs loading dock at Israel’s international airport near Tel Aviv. Several times a week in recent weeks, an Air Canada jet touched down at the airport carrying a group of the Lewinskys’ fluffy Jacob Sheep in its cargo. ”Come, Israel, come!” farmer Jenna Lewinsky said to one reticent animal, coaxing him out of his shipping crate. Each animal comes with a Hebrew name. About two years ago, the Lewinskys wanted help with their spiritual mission to repatriate Jacob Sheep to their biblical homeland, and they contacted Eitan Weiss, then the head of cultural relations at the Israeli embassy in Ottawa. ”I was like, what the hell? Sheep?” Weiss recalled. ”I don’t know. It sounded very, very odd, I had to say. But when I did the homework and when they sent me some material, I said, I think this is an amazing story.” The Israeli Agriculture Ministry was not as enthused. Canada is not on Israel’s list of approved countries for livestock import. But the Israeli ambassador to Canada got involved, and the Agriculture Ministry granted a   exception for the Jacob Sheep. Curious to learn more about the sheep’s pedigree, I visited sheep expert Elisha Gootwine at the Israeli Agriculture Ministry’s research organization, the Volcani Center. ”Jacob Sheep are related to Jacob the same as the American Indians are related to India,” Gootwine said with a chuckle, standing inside the research center’s sheep pen. The Jacob Sheep are originally British and got their name in the late 19th century because their spots and speckles called to mind Jacob’s sheep from the Bible, Gootwine said. Generally, all sheep can be traced back to the Near East, he said, because sheep were first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent. But the Jacob Sheep breed, according to Gootwine, is not indigenous to ancient Israel. Zohar Amar, a senior lecturer in the Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archaeology at   University in Israel, who studies the flora and fauna of ancient Israel, said the Jacob Sheep breed ”may have a long history in the U. K.,” but, ”according to all of the scientific indications we have (historical and zoological sources) it has no connection to the ancient sheep breeds” of ancient Israel. ”Anyway, it’s a nice breed and people will be happy to see it,” Gootwine said. ”It is a good story. For journalists, not for scientists.” ”So, it’s just, it’s a myth,” I said. ”Yes. But what is wrong with myth? If you enjoy it, why not?” Gootwine replied. The Lewinsky farmers say the biblical roots of the Jacob Sheep are not a myth. They’ve traced the breed’s route from ancient Israel to the Iberian Peninsula to England to North America  ” and now, to Israel. The Lewinskys are currently setting up a farm for the sheep near Jerusalem, and they are continuing to solicit donations for support. Five of their sheep died shortly after arriving in Israel.  Meanwhile, the Israeli Foreign Ministry is planning a welcome home ceremony for the animals. Is Israel their original home? The Israeli Foreign Ministry’s Eitan Weiss said he sees it as a matter of faith."
"As Donald Trump prepares to become president, he’s promising to explain how he’ll deal with the many conflicts of interest posed by his businesses and charitable foundation, even as he insists they pose ”no big deal.” But short of selling his properties and putting the proceeds in a blind trust, it’s not clear that Trump can completely resolve the controversies over his many businesses. ”There’s a uniform consensus among everyone who does government ethics for a living . .. those who are still in government and those who have left government, that Donald Trump must divest,” says Norm Eisen, former ethics adviser to President Obama, and a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ”He’s got to sell his holdings, through using a blind trust or the equivalent of it, as every president has done for 40 years.” Since his election, Trump has settled some outstanding legal disputes, including lawsuits over Trump University and unionization drives at hotels in Las Vegas and Washington, D. C. Trump’s efforts to put these issues behind him suggest he recognizes that he and his family face serious conflicts of interest, Eisen says. ”That being said, [Trump’s actions] are not enough. They are baby steps, when what we need is a giant leap,” Eisen says. Trump says he will hold a press conference soon to explain his plans for his extensive network of businesses, but hasn’t said when it will take place. An earlier press conference to address the issue was canceled in December. His transition team cited the complexity of Trump’s businesses and said he needed more time to decide what to do. But Trump himself suggested to reporters in Palm Beach last week that addressing the conflicts was a simple matter and said his businesses are ”no big deal.” ”When I ran, people knew I have a very big business. So, I mean, they elected me at least partially for that reason. So I think that’s going to work out very easily. It’s actually a very simple situation,” he said. One issue that Trump appears eager to put behind him involves his charity, the Trump Foundation. Trump has been accused of using money from the charity, most of which was donated by other people, to pay expenses related to his businesses. The foundation has acknowledged ” ” on its tax returns, although it’s unclear what specific violations took place. Trump announced on Christmas Eve that he would shutter the foundation, a move that makes sense, says former IRS official Philip Hackney, associate professor of law at Louisiana State University. ”It begins to eliminate a minor conflict. I really think the Trump Organization is a much more significant conflict than the Trump Foundation was ever close to being,” Hackney says. But the New York  ’s office, which is investigating the charity, quickly scotched the idea of shutting it down prematurely. Closing the foundation too soon could complicate the investigation, Eisen says. ”We don’t want any information to disappear into the ether when the charity closes. That’s a particular problem for Donald Trump because he has a propensity for secrecy,” he says."
"The Islamic State issued a statement on Monday saying it was responsible for the attack at a New Year’s Eve celebration at a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey, in which at least 39 people were killed. The   Amaq News Agency published the statement: ”In continuation of the blessed operations that Islamic State is conducting against the protector of the cross, Turkey, a heroic soldier of the caliphate struck one of the most famous nightclubs where the Christians celebrate their apostate holiday.” NPR’s Peter Kenyon reports the ISIS claim hasn’t been verified. On Sunday, Peter reported that Turkish officials identified several possible culprits for the shooting, including the Islamic State, Kurdish militants or   groups. Turkey’s   news agency says that nearly   of the people killed were foreign nationals. Clubgoers from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon and France are thought to have been killed. Funerals for some of the Turkish victims began on Sunday. A      woman was killed in the attack. Peter reports that her father warned her not to go but she insisted  —   wanting to be with her friends. Nearly 70 people were wounded in the attack, among them a    businessman from Delaware, according to the State Department.   reports that Michael Raak of South Philadelphia says his brother, William Jacob Raak, called on New Year’s Eve to say he had been shot in the leg. The search for the attacker, who has not yet been identified, is still underway, says Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. Police believe he carried out the attack alone. The Associated Press reports: Hurriyet and Karar newspaper reports Monday cited unnamed security officials saying that authorities have determined that the gunman who killed 39 people comes from a Central Asian nation and is believed to be either from Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan. Police had also established similarities with the   attack at Ataturk Airport in June and was investigating whether the same IS cell carried out both attacks. NPR’s Peter Kenyon reported on Weekend All Things Considered that Turkey’s prime minister says the attacker left his weapon at the scene and fled in the chaotic aftermath. At Reina, one of Istanbul’s most popular nightclubs, it’s believed some 500 to 600 revelers were celebrating the start of the new year. Reuters reports that the attacker shot at a police officer and at civilians before entering the nightclub. Many inside were said to have jumped into the neighboring Bosphorus waterway in an attempt to save themselves from the gunfire. The U. N. Security Council condemned the attack in a statement, calling it a ”heinous and barbaric terrorist attack.” Both the White House and State Department condemned the attack. The assault on the nightclub comes just two weeks after Russian ambassador Andrei Karlov was shot dead by   Turkish policeman Mevlut Mert Altintas and three weeks after a bomb attack killed 44 people at a football stadium in Istanbul. A Kurdish militant group claimed responsibility for the latter. Turkey, which is part of the U. S.  coalition against Islamic State, has faced numerous security threats. In all, there were at least six attacks in Turkey in 2016, claiming more than 200 lives."
"On a September day in 1940 while much of Europe was engulfed in war, four teenagers were walking through a forest in southern France when their dog fell down a hole. As they called for it they heard an echo. Crawling in to rescue the dog, the boys discovered a cave with hundreds of prehistoric animals painted across its walls and ceiling. It turned out to be one of the world’s best examples of prehistoric art. The Lascaux cave became a popular tourist site after World War II. But it had to be sealed off to the public in 1963 because the breath and sweat of visitors created carbon dioxide and humidity that would damage the paintings. Now the French government has spent $64 million building a near perfect replica to recreate the original cave  —   and the emotions of that first discovery. To see the replica, which is next to the actual cave, you begin outside, at the top of the adjoining museum. Visitors walk slowly down toward the cave entrance. All the while, sounds of the surrounding forest on a summer day are played on speakers. This specific order to the visit, referred to as the museum’s sequencing, is important to recreating an authentic experience, says Dina Casson, who was part of the team that worked on the museum’s design. ”When you visit the original cave, you’re actually walking through the forest with these sounds,” says Casson. Casson says recreating the impression of going underground and coming out again  —   from light to darkness to light again is also important. One member of her team was allowed into the original cave. ”That was one of the things that he said was so powerful,” says Casson. ”This sense of being outside, then inside, then outside.” Once inside the replica, the temperature is cool and constant, just like the real cave. As eyes adjust to the darkness there are suddenly animals everywhere. The more than 600 paintings and a thousand engravings in the actual cave were done 20, 000 years ago. Using a laser light to point out details, archeologist   Chadelle says these early human artists used very advanced techniques. ”You can see how they used a magnesium pencil for the black horns of this bull,” he says. ”And for the softness of the muzzle they used another technique. They blow dried paint made from natural ochre colors through a tool crafted from hollow bird bones.” Chadelle used to give tours in the original cave, which he says eventually became a victim of its own success. ”There were so many visitors that people were passing out inside the cave from all the carbon dioxide.” Chadelle says in the 1950s the hole the boys climbed through was opened up so a giant fan could be installed to help circulate the air. ”That’s why this replica is almost more real than the real cave,” says Chadelle. ”Because it has that original hole the boys climbed through.” Guillaume Colombo is the director of the new cave and museum complex at Lascaux. He says the art was so well preserved for so long because the cave was sealed tight  —   like a cork in a champagne bottle. ”So the cave wasn’t affected by sudden temperature changes,” says Colombo. ”And another reason it was protected is there’s a layer of clay in the soil that waterproofs the cave. That’s why Lascaux has no stalactites or stalagmites. It’s a dry cave.” Standing in the first big room of the cave replica, known as The Hall of Bulls, prehistorian Jean Clottes says the animals don’t really represent what these Cro Magnon humans would have hunted and eaten at the time. ”That would have been mammoth or reindeer,” he says. Clottes says the many bulls and horses were likely animals that played a role in the beliefs and spiritual life of these early humans. There are many mysteries surrounding the Lascaux cave paintings. For example, experts don’t really know how long it took to complete them. ”There was a code and a certain style they all follow, so we are pretty sure they were done by a small group, and in just a few years,” says museum director Colombo. ”But we don’t know if it was a few years within a hundred years or a thousand years.” Colombo says the paintings were most likely done by a couple generations of painters who passed down the knowledge. Such questions can be explored in interactive exhibits in the museum. Each visitor is offered a personalized tablet available in 10 languages. The glass museum looks as if it was slipped into a fault line on the hillside. Norwegian Thorsen Kjetilis is one of the architects. He calls the museum a link between past and present. ”It is a very contemporary building cut into the landscape and out of the landscape,” says Kjetilis. ”It’s just at the borderline between the vertical forest where the original cave lies behind us, and the horizontally of the farmlands in front.” The whole complex, known as Lascaux IV, is the third and most ambitious attempt to replicate the famous cave. It is precise down to three millimeters thanks to 3D digital scanning of the actual cave. Every nook and cranny is recreated using polysterine and resin, and the latest fiberglass techniques. Francis Ringenbach led the team of 34 artists who reconstructed the cave walls and ceilings and then copied the paintings onto them. He calls the   job ”colossal.” Ringenbach says to reproduce the art,   images of the paintings were projected onto the walls and copied pixel by pixel. The painstaking work gave them a real appreciation for the skills of the prehistoric artists. Ringenbach says they had a real level of mastery, and used the surface of the cave. ”These animals are not positioned by chance,” he says. ”For example, the eye of this bison is not engraved, it’s a natural cavity they exploited to make the eye.” Ringenbach says the more his team worked, the more astonished they were. ”Putting ourselves in the context made us realize how difficult the conditions were. They were working in darkness and working from memory to do these compositions.” Ringenbach said the prehistoric painters would also have had scaffolding that was fairly comfortable. ”They certainly weren’t working on a branch.” At times, he says the copy job became emotional. ”There were moments when I realized that I must be doing the exact gestures and movements of the prehistoric artist. And that’s when a little shiver would go down my spine,” he says."
"Hundreds came out New Year’s Day to ride the train in New York City, cheering as it left the station. That may sound odd, but this wasn’t just any subway or any old station, it was the stuff of urban legend: the Second Avenue subway line. To understand the crowd, you have to go back to the 1920s when the idea for the subway line was first floated, but never left the station because the Depression hit. The idea was revived again in the 1950s as a replacement for the elevated trains, but city planner Robert Moses decided to spend money building expressways instead. In 1968, the city finally got federal funding to build a subway on Second Avenue. It was expected to cost $220 million. The TV show Mad Men even worked in a reference to the plan when Peggy Olson, one of the main characters, goes apartment hunting on the East Side that year on the show. But it didn’t happen because in 1975 the city was broke. By the 1990s overcrowding on the sole East side line had become untenable so the idea for a Second Avenue subway line was revived, and in 2004, a plan was approved. The first phase would include three new stations that go from 72nd Street to 96th Street. The Metropolitan Transit Authority even gave a deadline: 2013. And a cost: $3. 8 billion. But the public was skeptical, as that deadline was pushed back to 2015 and costs crept up. The MTA finally settled on Dec. 31, 2016. On New Year’s Eve, at a newly renovated station on 72nd Street, Gov. Andrew Cuomo held an opening night party. There was a   band, a newsstand was converted into a beer bar, and the cavernous station was filled with purple, pink and orange lights. The governor helped secure more than a billion dollars in federal funding for the project and the MTA, and appoints their board members. At the New Year’s Eve party he told the more than 500 invited guests that the Second Avenue Subway is vindication of his vision. ”We needed to show people that government works and we can still do big things and great things and we can still get them done,” Cuomo said. The final cost for the three stations, and two miles of track was $4. 5 billion. And on Sunday morning, it officially opened to the public. ”I am so excited. I’ve been waiting for this for years and I’m thrilled to be on the first train,” said    Lillian Redl. Redl, who lives nearby, says the new line will shave nearly 20 minutes off her commute. And the new stations filled with colorful tile art, including 12 portraits by the artist Chuck Close, are snazzy. ”I love the high ceilings, it looks like there might be some soundproofing so I’m really pleased about that,” she said. And this announcement is sweet music to her ears: ”This is a   Q train via the Second Avenue line.”    train enthusiast Jared Margulis was impressed with the clean elevators, but had one suggestion: ”I think they got to work on the train, because the train did not say the right stop that the train is going to.” Residents are concerned that the new line will also bring higher rents that could push   residents out. The next phase will extend the line to 125th Street and is estimated to cost $6 billion. Tunneling could start in the next two years."
"What to expect when you’re expecting a baby dinosaur? Expect to wait. That’s the conclusion of a study by researchers at Florida State University who determined how long it took dinosaurs to hatch from their eggs by studying their teeth. Much like tree rings, teeth have growth lines called lines of von Ebner that can be used to estimate the age of an animal. Researchers had expected dinosaurs might take the same time to hatch as bird, between a week and a half and three months. But in fact, they stayed in the shell far longer  —   between three and six months. The leader of the study, Florida State University professor of anatomy and vertebrate paleontology Greg Erickson, says you can think of it like layers of paint. Every day, a liquid layer of dentine fills in the inner portion of the tooth and mineralizes, leaving distinct growth lines on the tooth that scientists can measure. The researchers studied two types of dinosaurs, Protoceratops andrewsi and Hypacrosaurus stebingeri. These two dinosaurs produced eggs that range from the smallest known dinosaur eggs, to some of the largest. ”The Hypacrosaurus had a four kilogram egg  —   imagine that as four times larger than the egg of an ostrich,” says Erickson. ”They look like volleyballs.” The eggs revealed that dinosaurs probably spent about three to six months inside the egg before hatching, depending on the size of the dinosaur. The long incubation time of the eggs could have played a role in the extinction of dinosaurs after the   extinction event. ”You can imagine after the asteroid hit all of a sudden the resources went to nothing,” says Erickson ”Even when they (dinosaurs) did reproduce, they had extremely long incubation periods on top of it.” Unfortunately for the dinosaurs, animals that reproduce quickly are better equipped to adapt to challenges and are more likely to survive extinction events. The biggest limitations to the study are the number of specimens the researchers were able to analyze. While dinosaur eggs are fairly common fossils, intact eggs containing a skeleton are very rare. Erickson and his colleagues hope to look at more dinosaurs, including carnivorous dinosaurs, to see if their speculations about incubation times are true for all types of dinosaurs. The new research published in the journal PNAS on Monday."
"John Grant is not your      . He’s a superstar overseas, but he’s relatively unknown in the U. S. where he was born. He lives in Iceland and speaks four languages. He’s openly gay. And he’s HIV positive, as well as a recovering alcoholic and drug addict. Grant’s journey from obscurity in Buchanan, Mich. to playing   gigs at London’s Royal Albert Hall started in the 1990s with his band The Czars, which released eight albums over 12 years. This was a big deal for Grant, who had come from a home where his parents were convinced he needed to be ”fixed” because of his sexual orientation. ”When I was young, people were so disgusted by me,” Grant says. ”Before I even knew that I was gay . .. everybody else had it figured out and, you know, they were letting you know.” Even as The Czars gained critical acclaim, Grant submerged   dysfunctional relationships and anxiety in an oblivion of alcohol and drugs. ”I spent a lot of time caring, and it drove me to really just try and annihilate my brain,” he says. ”I just felt that I was going to fall apart if I didn’t learn to be myself.” The Czars split. Grant stopped drinking, and he stopped making music for a couple of years of recovery. He says he began to find the courage to bring out his whole self through his first two solo records. He sang about being HIV positive, and railed against a bad boyfriend. Ultimately, Grant realized he was dealing with severe depression. ”Sometimes I still can’t believe how much it can beat me down,” he says. BBC 6 Music Presenter Mary Anne Hobbs says Grant’s songs can be painfully  . ”Most songwriting, even if it’s based on a true story . .. is embellished in some way,” she says. ”But John’s lyrics  —   they’re so true they might as well be written in blood.” Grant says people close to him have questioned whether it’s good to expose so much of himself, but he says he enjoys performing intensely personal music. ”Sometimes, you might be feeling like you’re dredging things up, but that isn’t usually what’s happening,” he says. ”Usually, you sort of dealt with it and went through it when you wrote the song. And then when you perform it, there’s just the joy of connecting with people.” Pioneering singer and broadcaster Tom Robinson was one of the first rockers to come out as gay and mix music with LGBTQ liberation. He says Grant’s 2015 record, Grey Tickles, Black Pressure, exudes a powerful confidence. ”If I had heard a song like ’Snug Slacks’ when I was a gay teenager in the ’60s, I think he could have saved me 10 or 15 years of heartache and pain,” Robinson says. ”It’s so great to hear somebody making music this unashamed and yet this irresistible.” Grant says he wants listeners to hear the fun in his music, because that’s a part of him, too. ”I want it to be a mixture of pain and laughter,” he says, ”which is a good representation of what life is like.”"
"Since George Washington penned his farewell address in 1796, announcing he would not seek   and laying out his hopes and fears for the nascent country, presidential farewell speeches have become a tradition in the peaceful and democratic transfer of power. President Obama announced Monday that his farewell speech will be Tuesday, Jan. 10 in Chicago. It will be held at McCormick Place, the venue for Obama’s 2012 Election Night celebration. In announcing the speech, Obama said he’s just starting to write his remarks but that he’s ”thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey, to celebrate the ways you’ve changed this country for the better these past eight years, and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here.” Presidential farewell speeches have historically been a chance for presidents to defend their accomplishments and lay out their hopes for the future. In some cases, the speeches have included pointed warnings that reverberate long after the speech has ended. For example, in his farewell address on Jan. 17, 1961, President Dwight Eisenhower warned the country about the growing might of the military, and specifically about the ”  complex,” the relationship between the U. S. armed forces and defense contractors. NPR’s Tom Bowman reported on the lasting impact of this speech in 2011, noting that it ”has become a rallying cry for opponents of military expansion.” Bowman said: ”Eisenhower was worried about the costs of an arms race with the Soviet Union, and the resources it would take from other areas  —   such as building hospitals and schools. ”Bowman says that in the speech, Eisenhower also spoke as someone who had seen the horror and lingering sadness of war, saying that ’we must learn how to compose differences not with arms, but with intellect and decent purpose.’ ”Another concern, Bowman says, was the possibility that as the military and the arms industry gained power, they would be a threat to democracy, with civilians losing control of the   complex.” In his farewell address on Jan. 15, 1953, President Harry Truman reflected on and defended his decision to drop the atomic bomb in Japan and mused about the start of the Cold War era. He said: ”I suppose that history will remember my term in office as the years when the ”cold war” began to overshadow our lives. I have had hardly a day in office that has not been dominated by this all —  embracing struggle —  this conflict between those who love freedom and those who would lead the world back into slavery and darkness. And always in the background there has been the atomic bomb.” President Ronald Reagan named the deficit as one of his regrets in his address to the nation on Jan. 11, 1989. He called out ”popular culture” saying: ”For those who create the popular culture,   patriotism is no longer the style. Our spirit is back, but we haven’t reinstitutionalized it. We’ve got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom. . .. And freedom is special and rare. It’s fragile. It needs production. So we’ve got to teach history based not on what is in fashion, but what is important.” In President Bill Clinton’s speech on January 18, 2001, Clinton hailed the economic progress under his administration and called for the U. S. to be a beacon of freedom and peace in the world. He also saluted America’s diversity, saying: ”In our hearts and in our laws, we must treat all our people with fairness and dignity, regardless of their race, religion, gender or sexual orientation and regardless of when they arrived in our country, always moving toward the more perfect union of our founders’ dreams.” President George W. Bush delivered his farewell address on Jan. 15, 2009. Despite his dismal approval ratings and a limping economy, he said, ”You may not agree with some of the tough decisions I have made, but I hope you can agree that I was willing to make the tough decisions.” He also called Obama’s election ”a moment of hope and pride for our whole nation.” Obama leaves office with his approval rating at a   high, according to Gallup. Despite Obama’s conciliatory   speech about   Donald Trump, and his administration’s ongoing transition work, Trump tweeted on Dec. 28: ”Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks. Thought it was going to be a smooth transition  —   NOT!” With the country fiercely divided after the election, Obama is expected to continue to strike a hopeful tone about the incoming Trump administration. And with much of his policy legacy  —   including his executive actions on immigration and the Affordable Care Act  —   at stake, it’s likely Obama will use his address to defend his actions."
"Erica Abad glides down the ancient canals of Xochimilco, a borough of Mexico City, on her   boat. Her cousin, Efren Lopez, steers their boat  —   called a chalupa  —   by pushing against the canal floor with a long wooden pole, while Abad flips a sizzling quesadilla on a steel griddle fitted into the boat. When a group of people on a nearby barge signal to them to order some quesadillas, Lopez navigates the boat toward them. And Abad places a few more quesadillas on the griddle for their customers. As the quesadillas turn golden, with the cheese inside perfectly melted, she fills them with huitlacoche (a deliciously earthy fungus that grows on organic corn) mushroom, chorizo, squash blossom and other ingredients. Abad’s chalupa is among many selling traditional Mexican street food and drinks, including sopes (a tortilla topped with refried beans, chorizo or ground beef, lettuce, salsa and a grated salty cheese called cotija) roasted corn and pulque (an alcoholic drink made from the fermented sap of an agave plant). The boats are surrounded by floating chinampas  —   gardens  —   with plants and small animals, like frogs, crayfish and salamanders. One chinampa is allegedly haunted, with creepy toy dolls hanging from nooses on trees.  Gliding past these gardens and boats are Xochimilco’s famous trajineras  —   vibrantly painted barges  —   that are filled with people knocking back micheladas (a spicy drink made with Clamato, beer and lime). Some barges even have mariachi bands playing on them. This is a typical day in this ancient borough, whose name means ”the garden of flowers” in Nahuatl, a language of the Aztecs. The chinampas were built centuries ago by indigenous settlers, who had found themselves surrounded by wetlands and needed to create spaces for growing plants like cactus, bougainvillea, bonsai and dahlias. So, they made floating gardens with tree branches, soil and mud, and tied them to juniper trees on the banks, to hold them in place. Over the years, the older gardens sank and new ones were on top of them. Today, the chinampas are no longer tethered to the banks. They look like little floating islands with plants, houses and other buildings on them.  The canals, which once helped transport goods from Xochimilco to other places, have evolved into a popular day trip destination in the last century. This borough’s history, beauty and a continuing campaign to protect the place from deterioration led UNESCO to declare it a World Heritage Site in 1987. Locals and tourists visit to enjoy the scrumptious street foods and alcohol, with the colorful sights and sounds all around. Lined up along the concrete loading dock is a long line of trajineras, with bright, swirly shapes and floral patterns painted on them. Their colors and designs have been an unchanging part of the boats for hundreds of years, reflecting the indigenous roots of the culture here. The trajinera have modern names these days  —   like Fernanda, Beatriz and Shakira. A newlywed couple, their wedding guests and a mariachi band dressed in white, board a trajinera with ”nuestra boda” (”our wedding”) spelled out in roses on an arched metal covering that shades the seated passengers. They drink and dance on their way to their reception, passing barges with a bachelorette party and a family enjoying lunch. You can spend an hour or four making your way down the long canals and experience a visual and aural symphony. There’s music everywhere. There are mariachi bands for hire. Or you can simply enjoy the Latin pop or club jams by rapper DMX blaring from rented stereos on passing trajineras. Dancing and singing at the top of your lungs are encouraged. As you float down the canals that once were inhabited by the Aztec and other indigenous communities, you’re treated to the smell of frying oil from boats selling quesadillas or the steam from boats selling elote (roasted corn smothered in butter, crema, cotija cheese, lime and hot sauce). And when you’re hungry, the boats will feed you and ply you with beer. The street food here is special  —   made with local ingredients deeply embedded in Mexico’s history. For example, the huitlacoche fungus goes back to the Aztecs, who gave it its somewhat unappetizing name, which means ’raven’s excrement.’ Food vendors take pride in the quality and   taste of their food. Lopez says all their quesadilla fillings are slow and patiently cooked at home before bringing it to her chalupa. And here in Xochimilco, you can enjoy these delicacies in a setting unlike anywhere in the world."
"Congress is back in session on Tuesday, and leaders of both houses say their first order of business will be to repeal Obamacare. If they do that, it will be a slap in the face to President Obama just three weeks before he leaves the White House. The Affordable Care is the outgoing president’s signature achievement, marked by an elaborate signing ceremony in March 2010 at the White House, with lofty speeches from the vice president and Obama himself. ”Today, after almost a century of trying, today after over a year of debate, today, after all the votes have been tallied, health insurance reform becomes law in the United States of America,” Obama said that day, to long applause from the assembled crowd. And Joe Biden famously leaned over to remind the president that it was ”a big f****** deal.” But Republicans have been vowing to repeal the law since the day it passed, and they’ll soon have a sympathetic president in the White House to sign whatever bill they send him. ”We will repeal the disaster known as Obamacare and create new health care, all sorts of reforms that work for you and your family,”   Donald Trump vowed last month in Orlando. That new health care plan hasn’t been fleshed out yet by Trump or his allies in Congress. So they say they’ll vote to get rid of Obamacare, but delay its demise until they come up with a replacement that will cover the millions of people who have insurance thanks to the law. Insurance companies and health care analysts are worried. ”I don’t see how you talk to any [insurance] carrier and give them any desire to hang around to see what they replace it with,” says Dr. Kavita Patel, an internist at Johns Hopkins University Hospital and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ”Why would you stick around for that?” Patel worked in the White House and helped create the Affordable Care Act. But she’s not alone in her concern. Last month the health insurance trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans sent a letter to lawmakers asking them to keep in place many of the financial incentives that are central to the law  —   including subsidies for patients to help them buy insurance and cover copayments, and a provision that eliminates some taxes on insurers. The American Academy of Actuaries also warned in its own letter that a repeal of the ACA without replacing it would be dangerous to the   health of the insurance market. Still, Republicans appear determined to move ahead with the vote as soon as this week. Some history: Democrats rammed the Affordable Care Act through Congress in 2010 with no Republican support. It was a huge, complicated law and, like most legislation, it was flawed. Over the subsequent six years, Republicans, who were angry at the way the Affordable Care Act was passed, refused to cooperate in any actions that would be seen as helping it succeed. Instead, they promised in speeches and television interviews to repeal it entirely. In fact, the House has voted more than 60 times over the years to do just that. ”There’s no getting around the fact that lots of Republicans campaigned hard against the ACA and a lot of them won, including the person at the top of the ticket,” says James Capretta, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But even with control of both chambers of Congress and with Trump in the White House, Republicans can’t simply repeal Obamacare. They would need the help of at least a handful of Democrats to overcome a filibuster. Democrats can’t, however, filibuster budget bills. So Republican leaders have decided to defund Obamacare, eliminating the tax penalties for those who don’t buy insurance and the subsidies to help people pay their premiums. Essentially, that guts the law’s main elements. The problem for Republicans is that today, an estimated 20 million people get their insurance through Obamacare. About 10 million buy policies through the exchanges set up by state and federal governments, and most of those patients get subsidies to help pay the premiums. And millions more are covered because the law allows states to expand the number of people who are eligible for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. So people who had   conditions that shut them out of the insurance market before the ACA passed, or people who had reached   lifetime benefit limits, generally like the law. But, then there are people like Will Denecke, who is mad because his insurance costs have gone up since Obamacare passed. Before the law was enacted, he spent about $340 a month on health insurance. ”Incredibly, we got a notice from my health care company, Moda, which has been having financial problems, that my premium was going up to $930,” he said last October. He’s a   urban planning consultant in Portland, Ore. and, unlike most people in Obamacare, he makes too much money to qualify for government subsidies. ”I’ve had health insurance my whole life, but it’s just offensive in principle to think of spending $1, 000 a month on health care insurance when there is a good chance I won’t need it,” he said. He was considering just letting his coverage lapse. And, on the other side, you’ve got people like Leigh Kvetko of Dallas. She takes 10 medications every day because she’s had two organ transplant procedures, and the drugs are part of her daily regimen to survive. After Obamacare passed, she was able quit her job at a big company and start a business with her husband, because she could finally get individual insurance. ”This particular plan, the fact that they cannot discriminate against me because of how I was born, was a lifesaver, literally,” she says. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told the Washington Times last month that consumers needn’t worry. ”We can assure the American public that the plan they’re in right now, the Obamacare plans, will not end on Jan. 20, that we’re going to be prepared and ready with new options tailored for them,” he said."
"Almost a million elephants roamed Africa 25 years ago. Assessments of their population now vary but suggest there are fewer than half that many. The main reason for the decline is ivory. Despite a 1989 ban on ivory trade, poachers continue to kill elephants for their tusks. Now China, the destination for most of that ivory, has announced it will shut down its domestic ivory market. Wildlife experts had thought that the international ban on ivory trade would slow or even stop the killing of elephants for their tusks. It didn’t. In fact, the killing got worse. That’s mostly because the ban didn’t cover older ivory, that is, ivory taken from elephants before the 1989 ban. So people are still killing elephants but passing off their ivory as old, and therefore legal to trade. John Robinson, with the Wildlife Conservation Society, says efforts to stop the supply of ivory at the source, in Africa, have not been very successful. ”Addressing the demand is absolutely essential if we are going to deal with the poaching issues,” he says. The biggest source of demand for ivory has been China. ”Almost all the ivory is for carving,” says Robinson. ”China has had a history of doing so. Whole tusks are carved into elaborately assembled pieces of one kind or another.” Now China has agreed to close down that legal trade by the end of 2017. Robinson says it’s an announcement conservationists have been waiting for since 2015, when U. S. and Chinese officials started negotiating an end to China’s trade. ”Certainly closing down domestic ivory in China will have a dramatic impact,” says Robinson. ”The Chinese market is the largest ivory market in the world.” Says conservation expert Elly Pepper at the Natural Resources Defense Council: ”It’s a game changer and could be the pivotal turning point that brings elephants back from the brink of extinction.” The Chinese government has laid out an extensive plan that includes putting ivory carvers to work on existing museum pieces or other projects. The government says it will also educate the public on the consequences of ivory trading for elephant populations. The Obama administration already has shut down almost all trade in ivory in the U. S. and several states have their own bans. Robinson says the Chinese decision may help convince other countries that trade in ivory, such as Vietnam, the United Kingdom and Japan, to do the same."
"The second day of January is National Science Fiction Day, an unofficial holiday that corresponds with the official birthdate of Isaac Asimov, the enormously influential and prolific scientist and writer of science fiction. The start of the new year is also a good moment to reflect on the future  —   an exercise familiar to both writers and readers of science fiction. But where New Year’s resolutions typically extend over weeks or months, the imagined futures of science fiction usually unfold years or centuries from the present. Interstellar travel and space colonization, if they come at all, aren’t coming in 2017. But maybe Jan. 2 is a good moment to take a longer view. What do the possible futures of 2067, or 3017, mean for the decisions we ought to make today? In an essay published in 1978, Isaac Asimov advocated for a ” ” way of thinking, a way of thinking that should inform the   of the present. He wrote: ”No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is, but the word as it will be  —   and naturally this means that there must be an accurate perception of the world as it will be. This, in turn, means that our statesmen, our businessmen, our Everyman, must take on a science fictional way of thinking, whether he likes it or not or even whether he knows it or not. Only so can the deadly problems of today be solved.” The ”fictional” in Asimov’s ” ” thinking shouldn’t be misread. Asimov wasn’t calling for baseless speculation, but for systematic and scientifically informed prediction  —   an appreciation for possible futures, all the while acknowledging their contingency on our current actions and the many uncertainties involved. If this form of thinking is for Everyman (and Everywoman) what does it mean for us, in 2017? Adopting a longer view helps clarify which problems merit special attention. New Year’s resolutions are often focused on the self  —   with dieting and exercise topping many people’s lists. But looking a century into the future can change that focus from the self to future generations. For me, that highlights climate change and inequality as deadly problems of today, and science and education as crucial   investments.   thinking isn’t a reason to give up on dieting or exercise. But it might be a reason to consider a more ambitious set of resolutions for 2017 (and for 3017, too). Tania Lombrozo is a psychology professor at the University of California, Berkeley. She writes about psychology, cognitive science and philosophy, with occasional forays into parenting and veganism. You can keep up with more of what she is thinking on Twitter: @TaniaLombrozo"
"Creatine, a chemical constituent of meat and fish that’s legally been sold online, in supermarkets, health food stores and vitamin shops for at least a couple of decades, may be the most commonly used   supplement marketed. But the safety and effectiveness of creatine hasn’t been rigorously analyzed by the Food and Drug Administration in the way that drugs are evaluated. And while proponents argue that the supplement’s long history of use by many athletes suggests it’s relatively safe for healthy adults, pediatricians warn that it’s unclear whether the supplement might harm the growing muscles and bones of kids and teens. That hasn’t been studied. The American Academy of Pediatrics specifically recommends against its use by adolescents, and most of the flavored powders, tablets, energy bars and drink mixes containing creatine bear warning labels that the supplement is not recommended for anyone under 18. Even so, use of the supplement among teens seems to be rising, particularly among young male athletes. Researchers at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children’s Medical Center of New York wondered whether retailers were appropriately cautioning high schoolers and middle schoolers not to take the stuff. So they did a little survey: A    undergraduate, a member of the research team, called 244 health food stores across the U. S. posing as a    football player seeking to increase his muscle strength. In each phone call he asked workers at the stores for their recommendations about which, if any supplements he should take. More than two thirds of the sales associates recommended creatine to the caller  —   despite the label clearly warning against its use by young people. The researchers published their findings in in the February 2017 issue of the journal, Pediatrics. ”The biggest concern for teens is the potential impurity of the supplement,” says Dr. Michelle LaBotz, a pediatrician in private practice who specializes in sports medicine and   the cautionary position paper on creatine for the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Sports Medicine  Fitness. Because the FDA only lightly regulates dietary supplements, LaBotz explains, the purity of these creatine products cannot be assured some have been found to be contaminated with other substances, including testosterone, which can impair a child’s ability to grow and develop bone. The body is an ”amazing machine which functions, for the most part, beautifully on its own,” says Dr. Ruth Lynn Milanaik, who led the study. ”There’s no need to rush the game of muscle mass, which can be added slowly and healthfully through clean living, a good diet and exercise,” Milanaik tells Shots. LaBotz says a solid, strength training program can increase a teen’s strength by 30 percent or more in 12 weeks, and is far more effective than taking creatine. Milanaik says her findings should be considered a ”call to arms” for parents, coaches, pediatricians and retailers, to address and discuss potential risk of supplement use, especially with adolescent athletes."
"Men who work out may be using legal    supplements to the point that it’s harming their emotional or physiological health, according to a recent study. The preliminary study, presented Thursday at the American Psychological Association’s annual convention, recruited 195 men ages 18 to 65 who went to the gym at least twice a week and regularly consumed legal   or   supplements  —   things like whey protein, creatine and  . Participants answered questions about their supplement use as well as their   body image, eating habits and gender roles. ”The heyday for illicit supplements for the average man is over,” says Richard Achiro, lead author of the study and a registered psychological assistant at a private practice in Los Angeles. ”The bulky Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone are not what most men are seeking to achieve now. They want to be both muscular and lean, and it makes sense that [legal supplements] are what they’re using or abusing.” Forty percent of participants, who were all men, increased their supplement use over time, while 22 percent were replacing regular meals with dietary supplements. Eight percent of participants were told by their physician to cut back on supplement use because of health side effects, and 3 percent were hospitalized for related kidney or liver problems, which can be caused by excessive use of protein powders and other supplements. Men who used dietary supplements inappropriately also were more likely to have behaviors associated with eating disorders. Achiro is no stranger to the culture of workout supplements. His interest was piqued when he noticed throughout college and graduate school how common it was for his male friends to use supplements before or after workouts. ”It became more and more ubiquitous,” Achiro says. ”Guys around my age who I knew  —   I’d go to their apartment and see a tub of some kind of [protein] powder.” Not to mention that this has become a   industry that’s grown exponentially in the recent decade or so, he adds. Achiro was surprised to find that most studies focused on illicit supplements such as hormones and steroids and gave little thought to the role of legal supplements, which are readily available at supermarkets and college bookstores. One big factor behind supplement use is body dissatisfaction, the study found. The men internalize a particular set of cultural standards of attractiveness usually depicted by the media: healthy, muscular and lean, ”like Zac Efron,” says Achiro. And they’re unhappy that their own bodies don’t meet that ideal. But the study also found that the men using supplements were more likely to feel gender role conflict, which Achiro explained as underlying insecurity about one’s masculinity. ”This isn’t just about the body,” Achiro says, ”What this is really about is what the body represents for these men. It seems that the findings in part [show] this is a way of compensating for their insecurity or low  .” Abusing whey protein and the like can also put gymgoers at risk for other health problems such as body dysmorphic disorder, also known as muscle dysmorphia, and related body image disorders. ”Body dysmorphic disorder used to be referred to as reverse anorexia,” Leigh Cohn, a spokesman for the National Eating Disorder Association, says. ”Someone with anorexia will feel they need to continue to get thinner and lose weight. With bodybuilders, they act in the same kind of manner. They acknowledge that they’re ripped, but are obsessed with certain body parts that they find inadequate. This drive for muscularity preoccupies them. Supplements serve them the same way diet products serve someone with an eating disorder,” Cohn says. For people affected by body dysmorphic disorders, this constant and compulsive behavior takes over their lives  —   they are constantly   and can be unhappy, dissatisfied, or have low  . ”Think about competitive athletics on the high school and college level. Lots of these guys are encouraged by coaches and trainers to take these supplements,” says Cohn. ”This isn’t thought of as a negative behavior but can have negative consequences.” The silver lining, Achiro points out, is that 29 percent of study participants knew that they had a problem of overusing supplements. But they might not be aware of possible underlying psychological factors. ”Guys think taking supplements is healthy, [they’re] convinced it’s good for them, [it’s] giving them all kinds of nutrients they wouldn’t be getting otherwise,” says Cohn. ”[This is] ignorance about what proper nutrition is.” It’s also not unusual for people diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder or its characteristics to also have a high incidence of depression, anxiety and alcoholism, Cohn adds. Although the research is preliminary and has yet to be   Achiro hopes his research puts the issue on the map and encourages researchers to replicate his work. ”This is just the very beginning. There’re still tons to look at,” he says."
"There are a lot of reasons victims of sexual assault choose not to report it. High on that list is fear of retaliation, so many victims won’t come forward unless they can stay anonymous. The criminal justice system cannot guarantee that kind of confidentiality for accusers and the accused. Further, when sexual assault is reported to law enforcement, a majority of cases never make it to trial. In fact, only 3 percent to 18 percent of sexual assaults lead to a conviction, according to research funded by the Justice Department. But a court case involving the University of Kentucky has highlighted how confidentiality can complicate justice. Jane Does on campus, Student victims have the option of reporting sexual assault to their school’s Title IX office. Title IX is the federal law that prohibits gender discrimination on campus. These offices are also tasked with investigating allegations of sexual misconduct and these investigations come with the advantage of guaranteed anonymity for both the accusers and the accused. The two women at the center of this case were graduate students in the University of Kentucky Entomology Department when they said their adviser sexually assaulted them. NPR spoke with both women as well as the accused. Because this story is meant to focus on the system, we’re respecting the confidentiality of the accused and the accuser. We’ll refer to the women as Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, and the accused as the professor. NPR obtained a report prepared by the University of Kentucky’s Title IX office in which the Jane Does allege the professor groped them and said sexually suggestive things to them while attending separate conferences with him. The Jane Does told NPR that confidentiality was the most important thing for them when they decided to go to the university’s Title IX office with their allegations. Jane Doe 2 said they never wanted to go through the courts because they couldn’t afford to be named. ”I just spent a good portion of my life in grad school trying to further my career and if I’m labeled as someone who filed a sexual assault claim against a professor, that could very easily backfire against me,” Jane Doe 2 says. ”There’s a lot of people in academia who think that there are women who make up stuff like this.” Jane Doe 2’s concerns about retaliation in her professional life is just one of many reasons victims of sexual assault choose not to come forward. Research shows that only about 35 percent of rape or sexual assault cases are reported. On college campuses, the percentage of incidents that go unreported is more than 90 percent, according to the National Sexual Violence Research Center. The Title IX office launched an investigation and after months of interviewing dozens of people and collecting all sorts of evidence, they found enough of it to move to the next step: an official hearing. Who presides over Title IX hearings can vary from school to school, but they are typically run by school officials and do not involve law enforcement. If those presiding over the hearing found the professor guilty, everything would go on his employment record. But that hearing never took place because the professor was allowed to resign, highlighting what Jane Doe 2 calls a loophole in the Title IX system. ”Not just at UK but at every single university, if a professor resigns before there’s a hearing then he’s allowed to move on to another university potentially victimizing more students,” she says. In a statement to NPR, the professor said there is no truth to the allegations and that he resigned to protect his family from the publicity and stress of a hearing. Seeking justice, This gets to the heart of why letting universities handle sexual assault investigations can be problematic. You can’t remain anonymous in a criminal case as the Constitution guarantees the right to face our accusers. It’s different going through a university Title IX office, where the primary focus is protecting accusers. The office keeps their identities confidential and there’s even a different burden of proof. Frustrated that there would never be an official hearing, the Jane Does reached out to the university’s independent student newspaper, The Kentucky Kernel. Marjorie Kirk was the first person at the paper to hear the women’s story. Kirk is a journalism student at the school who had made a name for herself as an investigative reporter. ”It was March and a person walked in asking for someone to talk to and I said, ’I can talk’ and they basically unloaded this huge story on me,” Kirk says. After hearing the Jane Does’ story, Kirk was troubled by the lack of transparency on the university’s part and wanted to dig deeper. ”I felt an obligation to the safety of other people to try and report this,” says Kirk. ”And that’s why we started this battle for open records.” The newspaper filed two Freedom of Information Act requests seeking all the documents related to the investigation. The university turned over some records, but not all of them citing a law called the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act  —   or FERPA, which protects the privacy of student records at all public schools and universities. ”And this institution, the University of Kentucky, has consistently held that student information, particularly in cases that might identifying a student in a sexual assault, sexual misconduct case, must be held confidential,” says Jay Blanton, a spokesman for the university. So the newspaper appealed to the Kentucky attorney general, who sided with the newspaper. But the university still wouldn’t give up the records and because of a quirk in Kentucky law that says the attorney general cannot be named as a party in a lawsuit, the University of Kentucky took its own student newspaper to court in order to block the documents from being released. For Kirk, the move was reinvigorating. She really did believe the university could have simply redacted names and other identifying details and now she’d get to prove it in court. This time a lot more was at stake than just one professor leaving campus without a hearing. ”A decision would be for all the marbles,” said Kirk. ”It would affect any decision that a judge anywhere would try to come up with for similar documents. They would see this decision and likely follow the precedent.” Kirk says that just two days after the lawsuit was filed, two people who said they were acting as representatives of the Jane Does showed up in her office  —   a point the Jane Does dispute because they say they did not have two representatives. Though the Jane Does had consented to giving The Kernel 21 redacted pages of the investigation, they say they didn’t tell anyone to leak the full investigation to The Kernel. Ultimately, though, The Kernel ended up with the full report.” In the more than 100 pages were interviews with witnesses and emails where one of the women confronted the professor about his behavior. The investigation also included the professor’s version of events. So Kirk began writing. She’d publish her first story after receiving the documents on Aug. 13, but the investigation didn’t stop there. ”And as we dug into the system a little more, we saw there was much more to this than one professor,” she says. ”And so the scope definitely grew into a system that universities were enabling.” Pushing forward, pulling back, While Marjorie Kirk was on a crusade, the Jane Does watched with growing concern. They were happy with the first few articles. The women got to maintain their anonymity and the professor was named. But then their personal story mushroomed into something they hadn’t signed on for: dozens of articles and an open records fight. In an effort to put a spotlight on one broken system, the Jane Does stumbled upon another.    can be successful in exposing  . But media outlets ultimately have say on how they pursue stories and aren’t subject to the same rules as the court or universities. So it’s really not surprising that The Kernel took the story and tried to expose as much as they could. In November, the women filed a brief actually taking the University of Kentucky’s side. ”There needs to be some sort of reporting system for professors accused of sexual misconduct while still protecting the privacy of victims like me and Jane Doe 1,” says Jane Doe 2. ”And the records that Marjorie is calling for, those hundreds of pages of documents aren’t necessary for that reporting system.” Judge Thomas Clark of the Fayette County Circuit Court tells NPR he plans to issue an opinion sometime in the next two weeks. But in the meantime, we still have a university struggling to protect students and hold employees accountable, a crusading journalist sued by her own school and two women still searching for a more perfect form of justice.

"After the countdown to New Year’s, Americans start thinking about upping the intensity of their workouts or making room in their schedule for a boot camp. But the men and women of the Hadza, a group of   in Northern Tanzania, have no need for resolutions to be more active. Anthropologist Herman Pontzer, an associate professor at Hunter College, and his collaborators distributed GPS units with heart rate monitors to a group of Hadza adults. The goal was to use the gadgets to pinpoint the level of physical activity in Hadza life. What Pontzer and his collaborators reported in a study published in October in the American Journal of Human Biology is that the Hadza are moving much of the time, typically in moderate and sustained activity rather than vigorous bursts. There’s a theory that human physiology evolved through hunting and gathering to require aerobic exercise, so that’s what the researchers were interested in testing. The 46 subjects  —   19 male and 27 female with a mean age of 32. 7  —   had their heart rates tracked over four   periods, covering both rainy and dry seasons. This data was matched up with what the researchers have learned about the Hadza’s cardiovascular health by testing 198 subjects (including 30 also in the   study). Their findings: An examination of blood pressure, cholesterol and other biomarkers shows no evidence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The typical Hadza day begins at sunrise. The Hadza wake up in grass huts in the middle of the savanna and mill about while figuring out plans and eating breakfast. Then the men set out with a bow and   arrows, covering miles and miles to track prey, such as giraffes, impalas and zebras. ”They don’t run,” Pontzer notes, unless, of course, ”someone jumps out of the bushes at them.” But they walk pretty much continuously, with just a single break at midday to avoid the worst heat. If they’re striking out with hunting, Pontzer says, they might chop into trees to get wild honey. Women go out in groups, along with children under the age of 2, who are usually wrapped up snug on mom’s back. They pick berries at such a rapid clip that Pontzer admits he couldn’t keep up with the pace. The tougher task is digging into the hard and rocky ground with a sharpened stick to collect tubers, which are a staple of their diet. The upper body workout can take hours, Pontzer says. It all adds up to about 135 minutes per day of    physical activity. Contrast that to the current recommendations from the U. S. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion of at least 150 minutes per week. And only about 10 percent of Americans achieve that guideline, Pontzer says. This Hadza study is ”very relevant,” says Oxford University associate professor Charlie Foster, who is deputy director of the research group on Population Approaches to   Disease Prevention and president of the International Society for Physical Activity and Health. In a sense, he says, humans are all still  . ”We’re good at gathering food whenever we can. We just don’t have to go very far,” Foster says. ”Within 100 meters of your front door, you can probably buy a coffee.” And what many humans are hunting for these days is an exercise strategy that requires as little time as possible  —   hence, the rising popularity in the Western world of short,   interval training programs, says Foster, who was not part of the study. So one detail about the Hadza research that stands out to him is that they pretty much take the opposite approach. Is there a way for Westerners to design an equivalent exercise to tuber digging? ”Maybe if you garden aggressively,” Pontzer says. But he advises against mimicking the exact patterns of Hadza lives and instead recommends thinking about what you can learn from them. ”What the Hadza study says is that you don’t block out an hour. You put a bit of activity into everything you do. Forget this artificial distinction between exercise and life. Try to change things so you’re doing them more actively,” Pontzer says. And keep on doing them as the years go by. One of the researchers’ key findings is that the level of ”moderate and vigorous physical activity” doesn’t drop off as Hadza age. ”You see   and    men and women keeping up,” Pontzer adds. ”There’s no sitting on a   .” The same is true with Hadza kids. As soon as toddlers are old enough to skip foraging with mom, they join a mob of children who basically just run around all day, Pontzer says. Other than some limited opportunities to go to school, ”a Hadza kid has never spent a day inside because there is no inside,” he says. Maybe that’s another lesson to learn from the Hadza, Foster adds. When it comes to exercise, he says, ”You’re never too young to start.”"
"Some prominent conservatives have signed on to a letter warning   Donald Trump that he needs to sell off his businesses to address his many conflicts of interest. ”Respectfully, you cannot serve the country as president and also own a   business enterprise, without seriously damaging the presidency,” says a letter sent Monday by a bipartisan group of politicians, ethics advocates and academics. The letter was signed by several moderate Republicans, including former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, former Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson and former Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, who was chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee. But the signers also include some   conservatives, including Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute, and political consultant John Pudner of Take Back Our Republic, which seeks to build GOP support for campaign finance reform. Pudner was instrumental in the successful Tea   effort to unseat   Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican. He also is a contributor to Breitbart News, which has been managed in recent years by Trump’s senior counselor, Stephen Bannon. A Trump supporter, Pudner said that cleaning up Washington had been a central part of the  ’s campaign and that now he needs to follow through. ”He made such a theme of things like the revolving door and the ways in which decisions can be influenced, not for the public good,” Pudner said. ”If you have the presidency and people are going to question every week, ’Why is he making this decision? Is there some business angle on it?’ I just think it undercuts so much of the reason that people did support him.” Other signatories included several   groups, such as People for the American Way, Public Citizen, Common Cause and the Revolving Door Project, as well as liberal Democrats such as Zephyr Teachout of Fordham University School of Law and Harvard Law School’s Laurence H. Tribe. Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told CNN on Monday that a news conference is planned for Jan. 11 to address conflicts of interest. But she added that the date might shift, depending upon the advice of Trump’s lawyers. In the past, Trump has said he will turn over his companies to his grown children to operate. The letter notes that the   has begun to address some of the conflicts he faces, terminating real estate deals in Brazil, Azerbaijan and Argentina and announcing plans to close his charitable foundation. ”That is a good start, but we wish to be clear that the only way to solve the problems you face remains divesting your business enterprises into a blind trust managed by an independent trustee or the equivalent,” the letter stated.

"There aren’t many Shakers left. Sister Frances Carr, one of three remaining members of the religious group commonly known as the Shakers, died Monday at the age of 89. According to the group’s website, Carr died due to cancer at the Shaker community at Sabbathday Lake in New Gloucester, Maine, ”surrounded by the community and her nieces.” The group’s formal name is the United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing, founded in 1747 in Manchester, England. Critics called them ”Shaking Quakers” for their style of worship which included ”ecstatic and violent bodily agitation.” Persecution led them in 1774 to emigrate to the New World, where they established their first community in upstate New York. The persecution didn’t end for the group that advocated pacifism, gender equality, communal ownership and celibacy. Still, the community survived and attracted more than 5, 000 followers spread out over 18 communities in 10 states just before the Civil War. Along the way, Shaker communities were credited with creating distinctive furniture and   devices such as the   broom and circular saw. The Shakers’ utopian communities declined after the Civil War. What remains today is the Shaker community at Sabbathday Lake. Sister Frances Carr was a    orphan when she was left in the care of the Shakers, according to The Associated Press. The surviving members of the religious group are Brother Arnold Hadd, 60, and Sister June Carpenter, 78. Hadd told The Associated Press that even in her final days Carr had hoped that the Shaker community would grow again, and that she would not be among the ”last” Shakers."
"It’s been 150 years since Fisk University opened in Nashville to educate freed slaves after the Civil War. The school’s later students would become prominent black leaders of the Harlem Renaissance and the civil rights movement. But the small school is still grappling with a dilemma that’s been there since the start: how to become financially sustainable. Fisk is perhaps most widely known for its music, but that legacy is intertwined with money. Just five years after the Fisk Free Colored School was founded in 1866, Congress stopped funding black colleges. Historian Reavis Mitchell says money dried up. ”When the school reached the point of less than a dollar left in the treasury, when there was no hope, a student chorus was put together in the fall of 1871,” he says. That chorus of nine students called the Fisk Jubilee Singers set out on its first national tour. ”They would present themselves  —   some the children of slaves, a few enslaved themselves  —   and the world was astonished by these young people from this place called Fisk,” Mitchell says. The Jubilee Singers became legendary. They performed at the White House for President Ulysses S. Grant. They traveled to England and sang for Queen Victoria, who instructed her court painter to create their portrait, which still hangs at Fisk today. And the tours worked. With the money the singers raised, Fisk bought the land it sat on and built the campus’ first permanent building. It’s a point of pride even today. At Fisk events, speakers frequently invoke the original nine Jubilee Singers, thanking them for their dedication to the school. But as their legacy lives on, so does the financial burden they tried to relieve. Fisk nearly went bankrupt in the 1980s. Then, a decade ago, it set off a long legal battle when it tried to sell famous paintings donated by Georgia O’Keeffe. The school was later put on temporary probation for its finances. That’s not to say it’s always been shaky. Marybeth Gasman at the Penn Center for Minority Serving Institutions actually wrote her dissertation on what she calls Fisk’s golden years  —   the 1940s and ’50s. ”And that’s really the last time that Fisk had like real financial success,” Gasman says. ”They were at the helm of [historically black colleges and universities].” To get back to that point, Gasman says, Fisk needs a few things. It needs stable leadership as the school has been cycling through presidents lately. It also needs to buckle down on fundraising by getting potential donors excited about the school today, not just its history. ”No one’s going to give to Fisk merely because of Jubilee Singers or Jubilee Hall,” Gasman says. ”They want to see what Fisk is doing now.” That’s the biggest challenge for Jens Frederiksen, who is in charge of fundraising at Fisk. He says he wants to move the school away from its reputation of being strapped for cash. ”I think for a long time we were probably mired down in a few familiar narratives that sort of usurped all the press,” he says. Instead, Frederiksen wants to highlight academics. For example, Fisk is nationally ranked for its master’s program in physics. He’s also trying to increase alumni and private company donations. The Jubilee Singers still have a role in all of this, 150 years later. They’re seen as ambassadors for the university as they travel around the country to perform. But this time, the fortunes of the school no longer rest on their voices."
"Lawmakers returned to Washington and wasted no time getting to work on the repeal of Obamacare. Sen. Mike Enzi,  . introduced a resolution just hours after the new Congress convened Tuesday that will serve as the vehicle for repealing much of the president’s signature health care law. ”Today, we take the first steps to repair the nation’s broken health care system, removing Washington from the equation and putting control back where it belongs: with patients, their families, and their doctors,” Enzi, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said in a press release on his website Tuesday. It’s the first step in Republican lawmakers’ plan to fulfill their most ardent campaign promise  —   to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a Republican alternative. Republicans have to use a special legislative maneuver, called a budget resolution, to undo the ACA because they don’t have enough votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Budget bills aren’t subject to filibuster, so lawmakers will be able to repeal the parts of the law that have budget and tax implications. That means they can essentially gut the law, removing all the subsidies that help   and   people buy health insurance and getting rid of the smorgasbord of taxes  —   on medical devices, insurance companies and wealthy individuals  —   that pay for those subsidies, Enzi’s resolution calls on the Senate to get a bill to the Budget Committee by Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers say they don’t want the 20 million people who have newly gained insurance because of the ACA to lose their coverage. So they plan to phase out Obamacare over time while they devise a replacement plan that they say will make affordable health insurance available to everyone, without the   mandate to buy insurance if you don’t want it. Many analysts are skeptical that this ”repeal and delay” strategy will work. ”The most likely end result of ’repeal and delay’ would be less secure insurance for many Americans, procrastination by political leaders who will delay taking any proactive steps as long as possible, and ultimately no discernible movement toward a real marketplace for either insurance or medical services,” said Joe Antos and James Capretta of the conservative American Enterprise Institute in a blog published Tuesday in Health Affairs. Antos and Capretta say a partial repeal with no replacement would lead insurance companies to pull out of the Obamacare market altogether, leaving those who get coverage there today with no insurance at all. It’s not clear exactly what will be included in the actual repeal bill. The best model we have now is a bill passed by the House and Senate and vetoed by President Obama last year. That bill eliminated the mandate for individuals to have insurance coverage right away but delayed the other parts of the repeal for two years. ”I can see how it would be hard for Republicans to maintain the individual mandate, which is possibly the most objectionable part of the ACA in their view,” says Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ”On the other hand, getting rid of the individual mandate immediately risks a collapse of the individual insurance market.” The ACA includes the mandate to ensure that both sick and healthy people buy insurance to spread the costs across a broad population and keep premiums low. If Republicans follow the model of last year’s bill and eliminate the mandate immediately, many healthy people would forgo insurance, and the price of coverage for sick people would spiral out of control, analysts say. ”That is a prescription for health plan disaster during this transition and brings into question just how many plans would stay in the program for 2018,” says Robert Laszewski, a health policy consultant."
"The House and Senate are back in Washington today for the start of the 115th Congress. With GOP control of both chambers and soon the Oval Office, Republicans are promising an aggressive agenda that will prioritize the repeal of the current president’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. The Senate is expected to start that process with a budget resolution this week. After the pomp and circumstance of taking the official oath and the   of new members is complete, the top Congressional priority is usually given the honor of being introduced as House Resolution 1, or ”H. R. 1” for short. With the rollback of Obamacare working first through the Senate, Republican Speaker Paul Ryan will not take the privilege of introducing that as H. R. 1, but looking back at the first bill to be introduced in the House in past sessions of Congress gives a glimpse at the priorities of legislators at the time. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Speaker at bill introduction: Nancy Pelosi,  . Control of House: Democratic Control of Senate: Democratic Final action on bill: Signed into law by President Barack Obama  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is the official name for what is generally known as ”the stimulus.” Washington was 180 degrees from where things are in 2017  —   Democrats had control of both the House and the Senate and Barack Obama had just won the presidency.   Speaker Nancy Pelosi used the H. R. 1 designation for the bill which was intended to address the effects of the Great Recession. Eventually Congress passed the behemoth $787 billion plan, which aimed to save or create millions of jobs and funneled spending to highway infrastructure investments, improvements to public housing and expanding broadband access to underserved areas. Before its passage, President Obama lobbied hard to get congressional Republicans to support the legislation, but the measure failed to garner a single GOP House member and only three Republican senators.   Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011, Speaker at bill introduction: John Boehner,   Control of House: Republican Control of Senate: Democratic Final action on bill: Died in the 112th Congress, but later became the legislative vehicle for Disaster Relief Appropriations Act in the next Congress. Following the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans picked up a net total of 63 House seats and regained control of the chamber. Much of the Democrats’ historic losses were blamed on a sluggish economy and backlash to the passage of the Affordable Care Act. With Republicans back in control of the House, Speaker John Boehner sought to make good on the GOP   promise to restore ”fiscal sanity” and cut back on government spending. He used H. R. 1 to introduce Rep. Hal Rogers’   Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 bill to do just that. In a statement, Rogers said at the time that the bill’s spending reductions were ”historic.” ”HR 1 provides $1. 028 trillion for discretionary programs through the remainder of fiscal year 2011, a level $100 billion below the level President Obama requested in his fiscal year 2011 budget one year ago.” But this was the start of the   ” ” era of Congress  —   not a whole lot was being done with a divided government as Democrats maintained control of the Senate and White House. Though the bill passed easily in the House and was sent over to the Senate, no consequential action was made on it. That is not until December of 2012. By that time two major events had taken place: President Obama was   and Hurricane Sandy walloped the East Coast with New York and New Jersey taking the brunt of the storm. It was one of the costliest storms in our nation’s history and more than 100 people died in the U. S. alone. When the Senate finally took action on the measure, it became the legislative vehicle to supply funds for disaster relief efforts. The Senate amended the bill and passed it late in the year. According to the website GovTrack. us, the bill died in the 112th Congress because differences between the House and Senate versions of the measure were never resolved. The bill was reintroduced in the 113th Congress and came to be known as the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. Implementing Recommendations of the   Commission Act of 2007, Speaker at bill introduction: Nancy Pelosi,   Control of House: Democratic Control of Senate: Democratic Final action on bill: Signed into law by President George W. Bush, Nancy Pelosi’s first legislative action as Speaker of the House was bringing this bill up for a vote. Fresh off their sweeping gains in the 2006 midterm elections that gave Democrats control of Congress, members were eager to demonstrate their national security prowess as the Iraq War dragged on Republicans. It had been more than five years since the 2001 terrorist attacks and Democrats intended to make good on a campaign promise to put in place many of the recommendations put forth by the   Commission, which was released in July 2004. The highlights of this legislation included funding increases to state and local government   efforts and mandating the Department of Homeland Security inspect all cargo arriving in the U. S. by sea and plane. A provision was added before President Bush signed it into law favored by many Republicans that shielded Americans who report suspicious activity to authorities. When he signed it into law in August 2007, Bush said he was ”pleased” by this addition but also called for Congress to take further oversight action. ”There is still other work to be done. I continue to believe that Congress should act on the outstanding   Commission recommendations to reform the legislative branch’s oversight of intelligence and   activities, which the Commission described as dysfunctional.” Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, Speaker at bill introduction: Newt Gingrich,   Control of House: Republican Control of Senate: Republican  Final action on bill: Signed into law by President Bill Clinton, Like our previous entry, this piece of legislation was the first introduced at the beginning of a Congress in which one party, this time the Republicans, were fresh off historic gains. The 1994 midterms elections, commonly referred to as the ”Republican Revolution,” saw the GOP take control of the Senate and seize control of the House for the first time in 40 years. Seeking to put forth conservative principles outlined in the ”Contract with America,” which the new House Speaker Newt Gingrich was chief architect of, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 was given the status of H. R. 1. This bill made certain that rules governing private sector workplaces are applicable to Congress. The bill passed the House with no opposition  . The Senate passed their version in similarly overwhelming fashion and President Clinton signed it into law. The action would apply a number of major laws to Congress including the Fair Labor Standards Act, which establishes minimum wage and overtime pay to employees, and the Americans with Disabilities Act that prohibits discrimination against people physical or mental challenges. The law also established the Office of Compliance, which covers more than 30, 000 federal workers. It is a   independent federal agency created to enforce the law and to serve as a place for workers to file complaints. Regulation Reform Act of 1981, Speaker at bill introduction: Thomas ’Tip’ O’Neill,    Control of House: Democrat Control of Senate: Republican Final action on bill: Died in the House, This bill was introduced in the 97th Congress and was intended to make regulations more   and directed each federal agency to provide instructions on how the public could take part in the regulatory process. The bill also required agencies to include instructions for the public to obtain agency reports on ”each proposed and final major rule instructions.” Democratic House Speaker Tip O’Neill slated regulation reform for the H. R. 1 designation following the landslide 1980 elections marked the start of the conservative Reagan era. That election returned Republicans to control of the Senate for the first time in a quarter century, in addition to giving the GOP the White House back. Other than a few hearings held by a House Rules Subcommittee, this bill went nowhere and eventually died in the House without coming up for a vote."
"One of the most stressful questions a new parent confronts is, ”Who’s going to take care of my baby when I go back to work?”  Figuring out the answer to that question is often not easy. When NPR, along with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, surveyed more than 1, 000 parents nationwide about their child care experiences, a third reported difficulty finding care. Searching far and wide, finding little  Megan Carpenter, a new mother who lives in Alexandria, Va. knows well the feeling of desperation that can come with the search for safe, quality infant care. She had a hard deadline  —   16 weeks after her baby was born her maternity leave would end and she would have to return to her job at a nonprofit that serves homeless and   women. So she and her husband started looking for child care early, only a few months into her pregnancy. ”At our first few interviews we were asking a lot of questions and were really trying to get a feel for the place,” Carpenter recalls. ”And by place 10 or 11, our only question was, ’Do you have a spot?’ ” The answer to that question, time and again, was ”no.” That meant getting on a lot of waitlists  —   and paying a hefty, nonrefundable waitlist fee each time. ”There were a lot of places that were totally willing to take our $100 or $200 waitlist fee,” Carpenter says. ”We spent over $1, 000 in waitlist fees  —   many of which I never heard from again.” By the time baby Cora arrived, the couple still had no prospects. Ultimately, Carpenter and her husband persuaded their mothers to take time away from their jobs and fly out from Georgia and Missouri to watch Cora in shifts until a spot at one of the centers opened up. Scenarios like this are playing out all around the U. S. An analysis of some 7, 000 ZIP codes by the Center for American Progress describes roughly half as ”childcare deserts.” While Megan Carpenter’s experience is representative of what many working parents go through, Narinder Walia’s is a   scenario. Walia lives in Fremont, Calif. and works in biotech. Her baby boy, Avin, was born on Halloween 2014. During Walia’s   maternity leave, trying to find child care nearly became a   job. ”I made   calls,” she says. ”Some were not accepting infants. Or they were full.” Of the roughly six dozen centers, only three were able to offer her a slot. Of those, she says, two were messy and disorganized. The third option, an   facility, set off some red flags. But it was the best available. Walia says her main reservation was that the center catered to toddlers and older children. Still, the owner assured her, it could handle a baby. What ultimately happened on Avin’s first day at this facility is every parent’s worst nightmare. ”I was on the way to go pick him up,” recalls Walia, ”and the Kaiser ER called me.” You have to come over, they told her. Your son is here. To settle Avin for his first nap on her watch, the paid caregiver had put the baby   in his bassinet  —   a move that goes against established   guidelines set by the American Academy of Pediatrics and is against standard practice in the infant care field. Research has established that placing babies   to sleep puts them at higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome. The caregiver told Fremont police that she turned Avin onto his back after about 15 minutes, and that he stopped breathing a short time later. On his first day away from his mother, Avin died  —   he was 3 months old. The coroner’s report confirms SIDS as the cause of death. ”I couldn’t wrap my head around it,” says Walia, straining to recount the day. ”He was smiling. He was a big baby, all chubby. There was nothing wrong with him. Even at the first and second checkup the doctor was like, ’Mama, keep doing what you’re doing. The baby’s doing really well.’ ” What happened to Walia’s family is rare. But it’s the deepest fear of parents who face severely limited child care choices. ”The market really doesn’t work”  These experiences  —   from disruptive frustration to tragedy  —   leave many parents wondering why the supply of quality, licensed infant care in the U. S. does not meet the demand for it. The answer boils down to the fact that child care, particularly infant care, is an extremely low profit field. Costs are high, factoring in real estate, supplies, insurance and, above all, labor. Many states require a ratio of one caregiver to every three or four babies. And, on the other side of the equation, centers can’t significantly raise their prices. According to a recent report by the nonpartisan think tank New America, parents in the United States pay, on average, $9, 589 a year for   care of children from birth to age 4  —   that’s more than the average cost of   college tuition ($9, 410). Many parents can’t afford to pay more. So, low profits  —   combined with high liability and the need to navigate complex regulations  —   make for an uninviting business climate. And, in this climate, the waitlist has become a tool necessary for providers’ financial survival, to buffer against unfilled spots and lost income. A select few providers are thriving, though. Over the past 30 years, the company Bright Horizons has grown to operate more than 1, 000 child care centers in 42 states and the District of Columbia. So, what’s the company’s secret? ”We’ve convinced employers to invest over a billion dollars, in either capital investments or subsidies, for their working families,” says Bright Horizons CEO Dave Lissy. ”That just didn’t exist before we pioneered the model.” Some employers, including Home Depot, Starbucks and Chevron, have partnered with Bright Horizons to establish child care centers primarily for their workers. These employers pay most, or even all, of the cost to build the facilities. ”After that’s all done,” Lissy says, ”on average, tuitions are funded 75 percent by parents and 25 percent through employer subsidies.” That means parents pay their college   sum, and the employers that partner with Bright Horizons pay even more on top of that. Bright Horizons is able to build these bright, cheerful centers because of this generous underwriting by employer partners. Without that cushion, the rest of the child care sector is largely operating on   profit margins, slow to grow and fragile. That industrywide weakness was a central finding of New America’s study of child care nationwide. ”The thing to remember about child care is that the market really doesn’t work,” says Brigid Schulte, an author of the study. ”It’s like education. When you look at the education market, it also doesn’t work. It has to be subsidized. It has to be seen as a public good, and the same sort of economic logic works in the [age]    early care and learning situation as well. We just haven’t thought about it like that.” An infrastructure investment? The idea of child care as a public good has increasing resonance with policy thinkers from the left and right. ”There definitely is an issue of child care supply,” says Angela Rachidi, research fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ”It’s an issue up and down the income scale.” Of all the ways the government could spend public money, investing in child care, she says, should be a priority. ”Not only does that then benefit children,” Rachidi says, ”but it also helps the parents work.” Katie Hamm, senior director of early childhood policy at the   Center for American Progress, agrees. Without much greater public support of the child care industry, she says, demand for licensed infant care will continue to outpace supply. But she takes heart from a campaign season where heavy emphasis was placed on the challenges American workers face when it comes to child care and the need for infrastructure investment. She sees the two issues as interconnected. ”It seems like there might be some consensus, both with the incoming administration and among members of Congress, that we need an infrastructure investment,” says Hamm. ”A lot of people talk about that and mean roads and bridges. But before parents get on roads and bridges and support our economy, they need child care.” For Walia, the mother from Fremont, Calif. more good quality infant care can’t come soon enough. She is expecting another child any day. ”I’m kind of being very hesitant even just thinking about the child care service right now,” she says. ”In my mind I just want to hold him tight and not let him go. But obviously that’s not practical.”"
"Ford and General Motors both reacted Tuesday to   Donald Trump’s continued criticism of U. S. companies manufacturing products in Mexico. Ford announced it would cancel its $1. 6 billion plans to build a plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and instead invest an additional $700 million to expand an existing plant in Michigan to make autonomous and electric vehicles. That comes on the heels of another decision in November to keep production of some small SUVs at its plant in Kentucky. That announcement came a couple of hours after Trump took to Twitter to criticize General Motors: ”General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U. S. car   free across border. Make in U. S. A. or pay big border tax!” GM responded that only a small number of hatchback models are manufactured in Mexico and sold at U. S. car dealers. ”All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U. S. are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U. S.” Why did Ford change its mind? The move marks a departure for Ford, whose CEO last month said it was looking forward to working with the Trump administration on trade but that it very likely wouldn’t change plans for its $1. 6 billion factory. Now CEO Mark Fields tells NPR that Trump’s rhetoric was a factor in reversing the earlier decision, but one of several factors. He says the carmaker was influenced by promises of new tax and regulatory reforms and the prospect of keeping jobs at home. ”Ford is a global automaker, but our home . .. is right here in the United States,” he said. What is the significance of this change? It means 700 additional Ford jobs will come to Michigan, and Ford says every factory job is likely to create another seven related jobs. ”We’ve created 28, 000 jobs and we’ve invested $12 billion in the U. S. in our plants in the last five years,” Fields said in a press conference. Shifting a factory itself would not be news but for the fact that it is highly unusual for companies to respond to direct, public pressure from an incoming president. ”I know from talking to business people that no major firm wants to be a subject of a Trump tweet,” says Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He says companies realize Trump controls the Justice Department, the Defense Department, the IRS, Treasury and regulatory agencies, and ”the amount of control that intersects with what companies are doing is enormous.” Will such moves inspire retaliatory trade barriers that hurt other U. S. firms and cost American jobs?  Trump has pledged to rework U. S. trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has also called for high tariffs on companies that manufacture products overseas and then import them for sale in the U. S. The question is how broad such tariffs would be, and whether American trading partners would object and retaliate with similar measures. So far, Trump has (or claims to have) put pressure on American companies including Carrier, Sprint, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and GM. But Hufbauer says if Trump makes good on actually raising tariffs, ”I think some form of retaliation [from other countries] is almost certain.” Who’s next, and what is the possible economic impact? So far, tweeting trade and other corporate policy has played well for Trump. He has targeted Boeing for a potentially large contract to build a new Air Force One, and he criticized Lockheed Martin for its expensive   fighter jet contracts. Hufbauer says it remains unclear what the economic impact of all this will be. So far, the tweets have gotten a massive amount of media attention, and that may mean it will continue and that others  —   consumer brands in particular  —   could find themselves targets. ”Some people may wrongly think this is the way to create jobs in the U. S.,” Hufbauer says. ”My estimate is that this kind of thing [companies responding to tweets] is not going to have a major effect,” and it is not in keeping with a   economy,” says David Dollar, senior fellow for the Brookings Institution."
"  Donald Trump said Tuesday that he intends to nominate Robert Lighthizer as his U. S. trade representative, potentially signaling a major overhaul of U. S. trade policy once Trump takes office. Lighthizer has long advocated a tougher stand on trade with China, which is in line with Trump’s campaign rhetoric. Lighthizer, 69, was deputy U. S. trade representative under former President Ronald Reagan during a time of ferocious trade wars with Japan. He has spent the past three decades as a Washington, D. C. lawyer primarily representing U. S. steelmakers in trade cases. He would replace Michael Froman, who led negotiations for the   Partnership, a massive trade deal devised to link the economies of the U. S. and 11 other Pacific nations. Trump says the TPP would take away American jobs and has vowed to pull out of the deal. He has also threatened to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, hammer out new bilateral deals and slap punitive tariffs on a number of U. S. trading partners seen as violating trade rules. Lighthizer gained plenty of experience negotiating tough bilateral trade deals on everything from steel to grain during his time in the Reagan administration, according to a statement from Trump’s office. The   says Lighthizer will do an ”amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity.” One target would be China, which Lighthizer has accused of unfair trade practices. He wrote in 2010 congressional testimony that years of passivity had allowed the U. S.  trade deficit to grow ”to the point where it is widely recognized as a major threat to our economy.” Going forward, he wrote, U. S. policymakers needed to take a more aggressive approach in dealing with China. Lighthizer won’t be the lone voice on trade in the Trump administration. Peter Navarro, widely considered a China hawk, will head up a new trade council. Trump’s pick for commerce secretary, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, also could play a role on trade policy. Lighthizer’s nomination quickly drew praise from many Democrats calling for a change in U. S. trade policy. Richard Neal,  . ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, called Lighthizer a skilled negotiator whose nomination could ”signal a welcome move in a new direction for the Republican Party.” Still, Neal acknowledged that many Republicans are advocates of free trade deals, saying Lighthizer’s ability to change policy will depend on whether he is ”able to overcome the resistance he is likely to face within his party.”"
"After a storm of criticism, including from   Donald Trump, House Republicans have reversed themselves and restored the current rules of the Office of Congressional Ethics. GOP members met Tuesday afternoon and agreed by unanimous consent to withdraw a change to House rules approved late Monday evening, before the new Congress was sworn in, that would have weakened the ethics office, an independent watchdog first established in 2008 under House Democrats. According to lawmakers in the room, GOP leaders said the change was a distraction from their agenda and that the issue needed further vetting. Public outcry, opposition from ethics watchdog groups, a divided GOP, and two tweets from Trump critical of the rules change prompted a swift reversal of the proposal authored by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte,  . Trump questioned, via Tweet, Congress’ priorities. He tweeted a pair of posts saying that while the OCE was ”unfair,” Congress had more important issues to take up, including tax reform and health care. Inclusion of the ethics measure threatened to bring down the entire rules package  —   the governing rules of the chamber  —   that is headed for a vote later Tuesday. The majority party traditionally passes the rules package on its votes alone, and a defeat would have been an embarrassing start for Republicans in the new Congress. House Ethics Chairwoman Susan Brooks,  . said that the ethics panel will review the proposal and come back to the conference with any recommendations by late summer or early fall. Republicans said they would like to have Democratic   to any proposed changes to the OCE. Several Democrats in recent years have also voiced criticism of the OCE, but Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,  . who played a critical role in establishing the office, has fought back any efforts to reduce its role. Pelosi said in a statement that ”House Republicans showed their true colors last night” and decried ”the toxic dysfunction of a Republican House that will do anything to further their special interest agenda, thwart transparency and undermine the public trust.” Democrats did not immediately comment on whether they would take part in an Ethics Committee review. Opposition to the gutting of the office was swift and came from some unexpected sources in addition to Trump. Exhibit A: Jack Abramoff, the former lobbyist, whose conviction on   charges helped lead to the creation of the OCE, told Politico the Republicans’ action was ”exactly the opposite of what Congress should be doing.” Former Rep. Bob Ney, who also served time after being convicted as part of the same scandal, said, ”House Republicans should not have done this and also the way they did it without announcing it is not a public policy to be proud of.” Judicial Watch, the conservative group that has led efforts to release former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails, called the House rules change ”shady and corrupt” and a ”drive by effort” to eliminate the OCE, as well as ”a poor way for the Republican majority to begin ’draining the swamp.’ ” House Speaker Paul Ryan had issued a statement saying many members feel that after eight years, the office ”is in need of reform.” Ryan argued the office would continue to operate independently and still take complaints from members of the public. He said the House Ethics Committee would merely provide oversight of the complaints office but insisted that the office ”is not controlled by the committee.” The Project on Government Oversight also chimed in, saying ethics watchdogs like the OCE ”need to be strengthened and expanded  —   not taken out back and shot in the middle of the night.”"
"Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly is leaving the cable network for a role at NBC News. In a statement Tuesday on her Facebook page, Kelly said, ”I have decided to end my time at FNC, incredibly enriched for the experiences I’ve had.” Kelly has been an icon for conservatives, but her decision to move to NBC, a network that   Donald Trump and some conservative pundits have branded as ”liberal,” is not a complete surprise. As NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik reports, Kelly’s career change follows a period of turbulence in her relationship with the network: ”[Kelly’s move] comes in the aftermath of her explosive accusations that former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes had sexually harassed her earlier in her career. And that was on the heels of her colleague Gretchen Carlson alleging the same in a lawsuit. That led to the departure of Ailes and to significant questions about what path Fox News would take forward. Her departure only raise the stakes for Fox.” Kelly butted heads with Ailes and her network colleagues at other times as well. When Trump, angered by a question she asked him during a debate, attacked her repeatedly during the campaign, Kelly said she didn’t feel supported by the network. In an interview with NPR’s Kelly McEvers, she said, ”My boss, Roger Ailes, was not able to stand Trump down. My friend Sean Hannity, who is a big Trump booster as you know, he was not able to stand Trump down. No one was able to stop his antics.” In the interview, Kelly said she received threats from Trump supporters for months. Kelly’s move to NBC News was first reported by The New York Times. Her contract with Fox News expires this summer, and the Times says rival networks were not prepared to match Fox News’ offer, reported to be ”more than $20 million a year.” The newspaper adds: ”The NBC News chairman, Andrew Lack, wooed Ms. Kelly away from Fox News by offering her a triple role in which she will host her own daytime news and discussion program, anchor an   Sunday night news show and take regular part in the network’s special political programming and other   coverage.” The exact terms of her new contract are not yet known. Kelly started at Fox News 12 years ago as a legal correspondent and quickly rose through the ranks to become one of the network’s biggest stars. Since October 2013, she has hosted her own nightly program called The Kelly File, becoming the    host on cable news after her Fox News colleague Bill O’Reilly, according to TVNewser, a website that tracks TV ratings."
"When spirits entrepreneur Steven Grasse considered writing a book about early American cocktails, he already knew it was a subject that had been, in his own words, ”done to death.” Ultimately, the book he did write, Colonial Spirits: A Toast to Our Drunken History, tells the story of a time when water was full of deadly bacteria, making alcohol the safest liquid to consume. As Grasse says, ”this book is about survival.” Colonists, transplanted to a New World, were faced with the task of   old recipes, often with unfamiliar new ingredients. Alcohol was a godsend in the Old World, sipped by adults and children alike. In the New World, imbibing called for experimentation. There was plenty of trial and error, and, in Grasse’s view, an unexpected recipe for democracy. ”Before democracy, there were spirits, and from spirits we created taverns,” writes Grasse in the book, ”and it was in those taverns that we laid out the blueprint for a new kind of country. . .. In other words, we got drunk and invented America.” With witty illustrations by Reverend Michael Alan  —   think Pennsylvania Dutch folk art crossed with Edward Gorey  —   Colonial Spirits thumbs its nose, ever so slightly, at the American obsession with mixology and fussily precise   cocktails. It does so by providing just one simple premise outlined on Page 3: ”In relating these recipes to you, and updating them for modern times, it was of the utmost importance to us that you  —   yes, you  —   would not die or even be hospitalized should you choose to make or imbibe them.” In all honesty, some of this stuff could kill you. In fact, on Page 154, you’ll find out that, yes, some home distillers were desperate enough to try making alcohol from sawdust  —   which Grasse reminds us would actually be methanol. So, yes, you’d die if you imbibed it, which is exactly why you won’t find a recipe for it in Colonial Spirits. What you will find, however, is Ass’s Milk, Cock Ale, and Lambswool (only one of them does not actually involve farm animals) with a    history of each concoction in question and modernized versions that sound, actually quite palatable. ”I wanted to make this like a Betty Crocker kind of book,” says Grasse. ”This is not a book for snooty mixologists. These are culinary folktales.” While many of those mixologists tend to laud the recipes by Jerry Thomas, the bartender generally credited with popularizing mixed drinks beginning in the 1850s, Grasse’s view is that cocktails existed well before Thomas was behind the bar. ”Cocktailing, as we know it,” says Grasse, ”was a result of industrialization and the rise of leisure time. But punch was clearly a cocktail, just served in a communal bowl.” Sharing and crafting history is a hallmark of Grasse’s career, which has included creating Hendrick’s gin, Sailor Jerry’s rum and Art in the Age craft spirits. A team of 65 employees in Grasse’s   company, Quaker City Mercantile, did copious amounts of historical research into the alcoholic recipes of early America. They dug through 17th, 18th and 19th century manuscripts detailing the booze preferences of Gen. Ethan Allen’s Green Mountain Boys, a failed attempt during the 1500s to establish a vineyard in what is now Jacksonville, Fla. and how rum was considered to be a cure for syphilis, malaria and even death. Many of the recipes are unfailingly simple: Spruce Ale starts with spruce essence made from Douglas fir tips (be sure to pluck those tips from actual spruce trees instead of some possibly poisonous lookalike, the book cautions, so you don’t, you know, die) which is added to chilled ale. The Everlasting Syllabub ended up being a favorite of illustrator and recipe tester Alan, who says, ”It’s essentially a big bowl of whipped cream that you incorporate a little bit of alcohol into. There’s really nothing bad about that.” During the process of recipe testing for the book, Grasse’s unique position as a distillery owner also gave him the opportunity to make a   production of one of the recipes, Martha Washington’s Cherry Bounce, a classic blend of brandy, cherries and sugar, typically enjoyed during winter as a fresh taste of summer. The updated version, made at Grasse’s Tamworth Distilling in New Hampshire, incorporates rye whiskey and smoked cardamom for a modern twist on a Colonial favorite, while also tipping a hat at George Washington, who was one of America’s largest whiskey producers. ”When I look at cocktail books, I don’t really get a context,” says Grasse. ”So my goal was to present the historical context behind these recipes, while making it relatable to the modern reader. I like to retell these stories in a way that people can digest.” He pauses. ”We’re inspired by history, but not slaves to it,” he says. ”At the end of the day, the point is to have fun and maybe learn something at the same time.”"
"Every year in the U. S. more than 30, 000 people die from things related to guns. That puts guns ahead of HIV, Parkinson’s disease, malnutrition, hypertension, intestinal infection, peptic ulcer, anemia, viral hepatitis, biliary tract disease, atherosclerosis and fires. Yet, the funding for research on gun violence lags far behind other leading causes of death, according to a study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Researchers evaluated the leading causes of death in the U. S. and plotted them against the funding and publication of research dedicated to to them. The researchers wrote: ”Gun violence had 1. 6% of the funding predicted ($1. 4 billion predicted, $22 million observed) and had 4. 5% of the volume of publications predicted (38, 897 predicted, 1738 observed) from the regression analyses. Gun violence killed about as many individuals as sepsis. However, funding for gun violence research was about 0. 7% of that for sepsis and publication volume about 4%. In relation to mortality rates, gun violence research was the   cause of death and the   funded cause of death after falls.” NPR’s Cheryl Corley reports that in a different study published Tuesday by JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers studied gun violence in Chicago over an   period to explain how it can spread like an infectious disease.” She said medical advocates have long argued that gun violence is a public health crisis, and that the researchers say their study helps prove this point. Cheryl says that: ”Yale University sociologist Andrew Papachristos said researchers treated the idea of gun violence literally and created a network from more than 100, 000 individuals at risk of getting shot. ” ’These gunshot victims  —   they’re in very small social networks. They tend to cluster together in these networks. And really what our study shows is that gun violence cascades over time,’ Papachristos said.” Papachristos said the study in JAMA Internal Medicine helps show there must be a more coordinated approach to drive gun violence down, one that treats it as a public health epidemic and not just a policing problem. The research published in JAMA offers an explanation for the lack of funding: A 1996 congressional appropriations bill that banned funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be used to ”advocate or promote gun control.” The authors of the study note that ”similar restrictions were subsequently extended to other agencies (including the National Institutes of Health) and although the legislation does not ban   research outright, it has been described as casting a pall over the research community.” Research, though, has proved an effective tool in driving down mortality rates from other leading causes of death. David Stark, one of the JAMA study’s leaders and medical director of the Institute for Next Generation Healthcare at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told The Washington Post that   deaths can be reasonably compared to motor vehicle deaths. According to the newspaper, he said: ”I think a good parallel can be drawn to motor vehicle accidents. Those kill about the same number of people, but that has been decreasing substantially. . .. All of that really starts from essential public research that determines the proximate causes of accidents  —   and it’s only with research that you can start to develop plans and policies and initiatives.”"
"   Demarco Webster Jr. was helping his dad move to a new apartment a few months ago, when he was shot and killed. His stepdad, Juawaun Hester, says they had intentionally waited to start the move until after midnight in order to avoid any trouble. Hester says Demarco didn’t even like going outside if he didn’t have to. ”I don’t understand man, and you know what’s going on now is like the future children, the good children, the smart children, with scholarships and they’re the ones who’s dying to the gun violence,” Hester says. Hester says just one day after his stepson was killed, his neighbor’s twin teenage boys were both fatally shot, too. Two more deaths in what has been a very bloody year in Chicago. The city has logged more than 700 homicides this year, more than any other major U. S. city, In September, the city surpassed last year’s total of about 470 killings. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel recently announced the city would hire about 1, 000 new people to work in the police department. ”These officers will be assigned directly to the streets of our communities,” Emanuel says. ”To work with residents in partnership to confront gun violence.” But many residents are skeptical that having more cops will stop the murders. The Rev. Marshall Hatch has a church in Chicago’s West Garfield Park neighborhood, one of the most violent in the city. He says relations between the police and the community have deteriorated since late last year when a video showed a Chicago officer fatally shooting Laquan McDonald, a young black man. ”They’ve seen it in their best interest to pull back and not be aggressive,” Hatch says. ”That probably has helped fuel a lot of the surge of violence that we’ve seen this year.” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said earlier this month that fallout from the shooting of McDonald has contributed to the spike in violence this year. But he says his officers are in a bind. ”They’re cautious about the national narrative that’s out there right now, so they’re careful about how they do police,” Johnson says. ”But at the same time the biggest reason for this spike is because our repeat guys just don’t fear the judicial system.” Johnson says Illinois needs tougher sentencing laws for repeat gun offenders. And locking up gang leaders did help in the late ’90s  —   the last time the city saw this level of killing. But University of Illinois Criminologist John Hagedorn says that comparison is far from perfect. ”[In the late ’90s] we were at the downward slope of organized gang wars that racked Chicago,” he says. ”Homicides were often called by leaders who were locked up in prison. They were intentional kinds of violence. Today the violence is spontaneous it’s local. The gangs are no longer structured and citywide. They are small cliques of kids. The reasons for the homicides are often insults, accidental events  —   very difficult kinds of things to contain.” Hagedorn says in the late 1990s Chicago police ”cleared” about   of all the city’s homicides  —   meaning they knew or thought they knew the culprit. Now, the Chicago police only clear about a quarter of all killings. ”So we are dealing with a different kind of situation, which calls for some different policing strategies,” Hagedorn says. ”But mainly it should tell the city that is has to address the roots of desperation.” Kyisha Weekly knows that desperation. Weekly says she tries hard not to think of her friend Candice Curry, who was shot and killed in a park when they were both 13 years old. Curry was the victim of a    on Aug. 10, 1998 in Bronzeville, according to a Chicago Tribune article published days after she was killed. ”She was at my house before she went to the park, and I was telling her to wait on me while I got dressed, and she just wanted to go to the park,” Weekly says. ”So I told her I’d meet her up there. And she went to the park and got shot.” Weekly says she remembers a group of boys from the neighborhood coming by her house and telling her Curry had been shot. At first, Weekly thought her friend would pull through, but Curry died that night. Weekly remembers Curry as a pretty,   girl who liked to jump rope. ”Our favorite spot to go to was called Route 66. It was a skating place, and it was skating on one side and dancing on the other side,” Weekly says. ”So our parents used to think that we used to go for the skating, and we used to go for the dance part until one day my grandma came and picked us up and saw all the people and how rowdy they were. She was like, ’No, no, no, y’all can’t come back up here.” Weekly says a few years after Curry was killed, a second member of the group, Charlene Johnson, was killed by another girl she had been fighting with over a boy. Weekly says she has also lost a brother and a nephew to gun violence. ”I try not to think about it,” she says. ”Sometimes I drink a lot to not think about the stuff that has happened in my life.” Now, Weekly says she hardly goes outside, except to take her    daughter to the aquarium or park. ”I love my baby. That’s why you can’t sit on the bus stop with your kids,” Weekly says. ”People getting shot, they’re shooting women, it’s out of control.” Despite the loss of her friend in 1998, Weekly says she is certain the violence is worse now. It was rare then, she said, for an innocent victim such as Curry to get caught in the crossfire. But not anymore. ”The gangbangers [in the ’90s] used to make sure the kids were in the house before they started shooting, Weekly says. ”They used to care then about kids, but now they just don’t. It’s the little kids. They’ll be 13 or 14 years old with guns. If somebody looks at them wrong. ..they want to pull out their guns and start shooting. And it’s like they’re shooting with their eyes closed because they’re hitting innocent people.” Member station WBEZ has been revisiting families affected by homicides in 1998, the last time the city suffered more than 700 murders.

"Ah, to work in France: plenty of vacation and a   workweek. And, as of Jan. 1, a new law that gives French employees the right to disconnect. Companies in France are now required to stop encroaching on workers’ personal and family time with emails and calls. The law was part of an overall labor bill that provoked months of street demonstrations and divided the country. The controversy was mostly over a single provision that made it easier for French companies to fire people. But nearly everyone supports the provision allowing workers to walk away from emails and ignore their smartphones when they’re out of the office. French Labor Minister Myriam El Khomri commissioned a 2015 study that warned of the health impact of what she called ” .” It showed that more and more French people could not get away from work  —   even when they weren’t there. Labor lawyer Patrick Thiebart argues that burnout and other   issues are on the rise because of an overload of digital demands on employees. ”If an employee receives emails during all their weekends and at night until 11 p. m. then I can assure you that at a certain point in time, it can negatively impact his health,” he says. The new law stipulates that companies with more than 50 workers must negotiate with employees and unions and agree on a policy to reduce the intrusion of work into private lives. ”Of course your boss shouldn’t send you emails on a Sunday when you’re at lunch, enjoying a leg of lamb and a good Bordeaux,” says Bernard Vivier, who runs the Higher Institute of Work, a think tank that focuses on the French workplace. ”It’s so French to throw a law at every kind of problem,” he says. But he doesn’t think a law can fix this one. Such ills must be changed by management and through new practices, he says. It’s a complicated issue, notes Thiebart, the lawyer, because digital culture also offers employees freedom and flexibility. ”Everybody is happy with the smartphones and the new technology,” Thiebart says, ”because employees can work at home and don’t have to spend time and money in commuting. And for companies, they can save money because they don’t need all the staff on the premises.” Many large European companies and government departments already recognize the right of their employees to disconnect from work. Companies such as Volkswagen and Daimler, and French insurer Axa, have taken steps to restrict    messaging  —   including Volkswagen’s limited email server connections on evenings and weekends. Thiebart says that isn’t such a good idea, since many businesses operate across several time zones. But he says his clients, many of them large corporations, are not hostile to the new French law. They believe a lack of downtime decreases the productivity of their workforce. At a Paris gym where people are working up a sweat after a day at the office, many are still attached to their devices. Jean Luc Bauché is lifting weights, wearing white earbuds connected to a smartphone in his pocket. He says it’s a great idea to be able to disconnect. But he doesn’t think it’s possible. ”You can pass laws to protect people from dangers like speeding,” he says, ”but this law won’t work because it’s counter to the way society is evolving.” Bauché says he’s the only person he knows who turns his phone off at night when he sleeps. ”Most people don’t dare,” he says. ”They’re afraid they’ll miss something.”"
"Viridiana Martinez’s parents brought her to the U. S. illegally when she was 7. But it wasn’t until she was in her 20s, when she took the microphone at a rally in Durham, N. C. that she ”came out” as being unauthorized herself. Martinez, now 30, has been on the front lines of the immigrant rights movement in North Carolina ever since. She   the North Carolina Dream Team, which advocated for immigrants who were brought to the U. S. illegally by their parents. She was once arrested at a   demonstration in Atlanta, risking being turned over to immigration agents for the sake of protest. A year ago, she helped launch Alerta Migratoria, a hotline that immigrants in North Carolina can call to report the presence of ICE agents in their communities (it forwards calls to her cellphone). In other words, Martinez is just the kind of person you might expect to be terrified by Trump’s ascension to the presidency, given his promise to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally and repeal President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has granted Martinez and 730, 000 young immigrants like her work permits and temporary protection from deportation. And yet, sitting on a futon in her tidy apartment in Raleigh recently, Martinez said she wasn’t upset by Trump’s victory. In fact, quite the opposite. ”I’m actually happy that Donald Trump won,” she said. ”I am. I’m very happy, because this is an opportunity to take a new approach at immigrant rights organizing.” For Martinez and others advocating on behalf of immigrants, this election has surfaced some unexpected opportunities. In the battle over the fates of people in the country illegally, Trump’s election may look like a victory for those who would have the federal government expel as many as possible. But people like Martinez are finding that the simple fear of that possibility has given their   efforts a shot in the arm. Viewing Trump as a grave threat to their immigrant communities, many local lawmakers are reacting to his deportation proposals with the kind of defiance that   advocates have been asking of them for years. ”I mean, sure, it sucks that it took Donald Trump winning,” Martinez said, ”but it’s already moving people to act.” She was referring to reports from across the country of mayors, police chiefs, city council members dozens of public officials who have vowed to defy Trump should he try to enlist them to deport people. Though the   has scaled back his most sweeping campaign promise to deport all 11 million immigrants in the country illegally, many local officials are taking no chances. ”If the federal government wants our police officers to tear immigrant families apart, we will refuse to do it,” New York Mayor Bill De Blasio said in a speech days after the November election. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced a $10 million fund to provide lawyers for immigrants facing deportation. ”We don’t know how far the new administration will go when it comes to our nation’s immigration policy,” he said, ”but we all heard the rhetoric.” In smaller cities and towns, from Arizona to Iowa to North Carolina, officials have taken a similar tone. This is exciting for   activists like Martinez. During the past eight years, many efforts to advance immigrant rights in the absence of a federal immigration reform bill were aimed at persuading the Obama administration to act unilaterally through programs like DACA. Now, in anticipation of Trump, the strategy appears to be shifting. Activists say they’ll focus on persuading local officials to be more aggressive in protecting immigrants in the country illegally from the federal government. ”In the coming years you’re going to see people fighting to establish new civil rights protections in cities by forging new ground with policies that might not have been deemed possible even as recently as two months ago,” said Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, a   immigrant advocacy group. The public statements many local officials have made in recent weeks, he said, suggest that cities will be receptive to this strategy. Officials in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago have already started acting. For activists like Martinez, there’s a tinge of frustration over the fact that it took Trump’s election to spur this response. ”Because the reality is, we just came out of a presidency where the administration has deported more immigrants than any other,” she said. ”And the only reason this is happening now is because our   is Donald Trump.” It’s hard to say for sure whether Obama outdeported all of his predecessors. Interpreting the statistics can be tricky because the government’s method for tracking deportations has changed over time. Department of Homeland Security figures indicate the Obama administration will have deported about 3 million people by the time the president leaves office. The George W. Bush administration deported roughly 2 million. Martinez said that for years, she has been watching families get torn apart by Obama’s deportation policies. So, while Trump’s rhetoric has been alarming, she said she sees little substantive difference between his most recent proposal  —   to deport 2 to 3 million immigrants he says have criminal records  —   and what Obama has already done. ”It’s like a guy who tells you you’re ugly to your face versus a guy who tells you you’re pretty, but then turns around and tells his friend, ’Damn, she’s ugly!’ ” Martinez said. Martinez said the problem is that for the past eight years, many local officials were convinced by the ”you’re pretty” guy  —   Obama, in this case  —   and didn’t feel the need to take as forceful a stance against his deportations as they now are taking against Trump. ”I think people were conformed, complacent,” she said, ”and they felt that under a Democratic presidency things could not be bad that President Obama was a friend of immigrants, even though that was far from the truth.” Obama, critics like Newman and Martinez say, believed that to gain Republican support for an immigration reform bill that included legalization for millions, he also had to prove he could be tough on enforcement. It was a strategic gambit that failed, Newman said. Obama deported millions while Republicans blocked immigration reform efforts that might have made it possible for immigrants in the country illegally to gain legal status. ”And he was able to, on a certain level, get away with it” among his allies, Newman said, ”as long as people believed that he was also in favor of something that might not have ever been possible  —   namely, comprehensive immigration reform.” Kevin De Leon, the Democratic leader of the California state Senate, represents a heavily immigrant district in Los Angeles. Earlier this month, he introduced a bill he calls the California Values Act. It would prohibit police departments from devoting resources to enforcing federal immigration laws. Addressing unauthorized immigrants in a statement announcing the bill, De Leon said ”the state of California will be your wall of justice.” This is the sort of thing activists in California have been asking for for years, through a campaign called ”ICE Out of California.” The campaign’s goal has been to persuade local and state officials to kick Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents out of local jails to make it harder for them to take immigrants into federal custody when they’re arrested by local police. Asked to consider the argument that a lot of these new   measures should have been put in place years ago, given Obama’s deportation record, De Leon said he understands why many activists might feel that way. ”But this is very different,” he said. He called Trump’s deportation promises during the campaign unprecedented. ”It’s a very pernicious,   type of campaigning that we have yet to ever see. And I think that is the major difference.” De Leon said part of what concerns him about Trump is his unpredictability. The   promised so many things, has changed his posture on major issues so many times, that it’s impossible to know exactly what he’ll do, De Leon said. Because of that, he said, California has to ”prepare for the worst.” Martinez is skeptical that it will get any worse. Trump is a businessman, she said, and he understands the value of immigrant labor. Still, she said she appreciates the steps officials are taking to enshrine into law protections for immigrants at the local level. She and fellow activists in Durham have a list of proposals they plan to bring to the City Council, which has proved to be  .   of Durham’s recent population growth has come from immigration, both legal and illegal. Newman, of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said that as justified as many immigrant advocates are in fearing a Trump presidency, there’s also reason to believe some good will come of it. In the past, liberal leaders have held out hope for an immigration reform bill, he said. Now they seem to agree that a sensible bill is unlikely under a government controlled by conservatives. ”And the absence of that possibility has in some ways been liberating for local policymakers,” he said. Now, Newman said, he expects local leaders and activists will start to ”experiment with a range of decentralized tactics” that will make cities the locus for policies aimed at better treatment of immigrants. ”Legalization from below,” he called it. In some cities it’s already started, with initiatives like the legal defense fund in LA and the refusal by many cities to put their law enforcement officers at the disposal of federal immigration agents. Officials in other cities have said they will look into becoming   sanctuary cities, jurisdictions with policies to protect immigrants who are in the country illegally. The city of Santa Ana, Calif. took that step in December. Newman said that activists in other cities are organizing to push their local leaders to follow suit."
"Beijing’s sky appears blue at the beginning of the   video. Then it completely disappears from view, blotted out by a cloud of brown smog. The   video shot Sunday by Chas Pope, a British citizen, dramatically illustrates the extent of China’s pollution problem. Pope says the thick haze moved into Beijing over the course of 20 minutes. Dozens of Chinese cities have suffered heavy smog for nearly a month. ”State media report that 72 Chinese cities are under pollution alerts,” NPR’s Anthony Kuhn reports from Beijing. ”Environmental officials have fined some 500 factories that have failed to cut emissions as the alerts require, and some 10, 000 heavily polluting vehicles that are on the roads in violation of the alert.” Some 40, 000 inspectors have been deployed to make sure everyone is complying with required emissions cuts, Anthony adds.   of the Chinese cities are on red alert, the most severe level of air pollution, according to a statement from the country’s Ministry of Environmental Protection. Schools in   areas were suspending classes, the ministry said. It added that conditions were expected to improve by Friday. The crackdown on industries that are violating environmental regulations is part of China’s larger ”war on pollution,” now in its third year, Reuters reports. The news service says it’s ”aimed at reversing the damage done to its skies, soil and water after decades of untrammeled economic growth.” But there are major challenges in curbing pollution. Recently, ”state media have also reported that some local environmental authorities are tampering with air quality monitors to make pollution look lighter than it actually is,” Anthony says. China’s pollution issues also are exacerbated in the winter. According to The New York Times, ”residents have come to expect such dense air pollution in late fall and winter, as people burn coal to heat their homes.” A recent World Health Organization study found that China had the most deaths in the world attributable to air quality in 2012  —   at 1, 032, 833."
"It’s 1968 in New Bordeaux, La. On the surface all looks tranquil as you drive through the bustling city in your red Pontiac, tapping your foot to Sam Cooke’s ”Chain Gang.” But as you take a sharp left down a winding back alley, an alarming sight gives you pause. Behind you, trucks painted with the Confederate flag begin to appear, the white men behind the wheel angry and visceral as they shout racial slurs. Your name is Lincoln Clay. You’re a    biracial man  —   but in this place, this time, you’re black, and instances of racism and bigotry are commonplace. This is Mafia III, an   video game developed by Hangar 13 and published by 2K Games. It’s a game that, in a lot of ways, meticulously adopts and adapts from the racial and political history of the era. And it’s become a provocative and in some ways cathartic alternate reality that directly confronts gamers of all walks of life with the reimagined raw trials of a protagonist rarely featured by the industry. The game’s authentic use of past racial tensions isn’t the crux of the plot  —   its premise is similar to other Mafia games, in which a protagonist goes up against the mob. But their presentation is heavy and deliberate. Senior writer Charles Webb says the creators wanted to spark players’ consciousness without overindulging in a history lesson. ”One of the things I’m really, really proud of is we’ve kind of created this game of empathy,” Webb says. ”This is what it was like to occupy this space, as this particular type of person, as a young black man in 1968 in the South.” Grounded in history, As you drive throughout the city or make a pit stop for some quick cash, music of the era  —   Nina Simone or Janis Joplin  —   keeps you company. News broadcasts reflect the period, announcing tragedies like the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or the arrests of Freedom Riders. ”We attached ourselves to this idea of the documentary. It gets you to think about how have things changed, if at all,” says Creative Director Haden Blackman. The writers say they did extensive research, studying films, documentaries and literature, including The Trials of Muhammad Ali The Black Power Mixtape   the James Baldwin debates with William F. Buckley from 1965 and Matterhorn: A Novel of the Vietnam War. The writers cited ”The Ballot or the Bullet,” speech from April of ’64 by Malcolm X as a primary influence. An invisible character by the name of ”The Voice” delivers evidence of this research: As a radio personality, he often speaks directly to the player, providing critical commentary and analysis of the prejudice and injustices within this reimagined narrative. ”Being able to have him as this ’voice of the people’ in the city, especially of the marginalized, specifically black community, at the time  —   it’s one of those things that really helps tie things together,” says Senior Writer Ed Fowler. ”The way that it evokes the time and still resonates today speaks to many things, just in general in our world right now.” ’Scared as all  ’ With so much history involved, the team admits the game’s subject matter can be, at times, grueling and potent. As Clay, you go on a mission to dismantle the Ku Klux Klan and confront other white supremacists groups on numerous side quests. You hear racial slurs and witness hateful acts against  . The police watch you  —   always. The game’s open world is abundant but you, the player, are not welcome in every aspect of its landscape, simply on the basis that you are you. The ambiance of bigotry  —   quiet or bombastic  —   is consistent, whether in hateful glances when you walk through areas reserved for ”whites only” or the seemingly increased police presence when you stroll through predominantly white suburbs. The team knew the game had the potential to be polarizing. ”I was definitely scared, scared as all ” Webb says. ”It was very important to our team as a whole to hammer home to be authentic and true to the period, and that’s a fine line . .. not only respecting how hostile this space might be toward Lincoln but also figuring out ways to not make it completely repellent to the player.” It all appears to have worked, as Mafia III became the   title by 2K Games, with more than 4 million units shipped in the first week. But despite the game’s positive reception, some reviewers have argued that its excessive and chaotic violence overshadows the abuse black and brown people experienced during the era, as The Verge’s Chris Plante has argued: ”A black man lynching a white man in the American South in 1968 is an arresting image, except its power is undercut by the game’s pace. It takes no time to unpack what we’re seeing, let alone acknowledge that, below the hanging man, fester dozens of other men murdered by Lincoln Clay.” Female representation, Still, Mafia III inches away from the familiar tropes of  ’  games. One of them is the poor depiction of women, who are often heavily sexualized or subservient to the male protagonist. In Mafia III, women hold their own and serve more than just atmosphere, which Webb says was a deliberate move. There’s Cassandra, the head of the Haitian mob then Alma Diaz, who runs smuggling operations and Nicki Burke, a lieutenant in the Irish mob. And then there’s the inner circle of Clay’s friends and family, most of whom are black and help shape the narrative. This batch of characters joins a small group of other individuals of color from recent major games: Marcus Holloway from Watch Dogs 2, antagonist Nadine Ross from Uncharted 4 and Lee Everett from The Walking Dead Telltale games universe and others. Yet, many groups remain highly underrepresented in the gaming industry, which has faced criticism, for instance, not only for the rarity of protagonists of color, but also for their voices being performed by white voice actors. A 2009 study found that Latinos were virtually unrepresented as playable characters, while   were largely featured in sports games or similar titles that reinforce stereotypes. A possible harbinger? S. Craig Watkins, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, says the tech industry is commonly under fire for its lack of diversity, while the video game industry hasn’t been held ”nearly as accountable.” The vast majority of game developers are white  —   the results of a 2015 survey by the International Game Developers Association suggest that only about 3 percent of   makers are African American and 7 percent are Latino. Meanwhile, several studies have found that black and Latino children and teenagers spend more time per day playing video games. ”The statistics are shifting and telling us that who plays games is no longer this imagined idea of the white straight   adolescent male who is at home in their parents’ basement,” says Edmond Chang, a visiting assistant professor at the University of Oregon. ”The industry has really failed in certain ways to catch up.” Watkins says Mafia III could be a harbinger for the industry. ”The idea that a studio would even consider investing the resources, the time, the human capital to develop a game like Mafia III,” he says, ”that’s a really interesting approach to what the gaming world and experience might look like.” And Blackman, the creative director, says he’s proud of the game sparking important dialogue. ”We’re not so naive as to think that a single game could cure racism  —   and that was never our intent,” Blackman says. ”But at the end of the day, if we make people think about race and we make people think about what’s happening today, I think we’ve done something that very few games have done.” Iman Smith is a freelance reporter.

"One in five Americans is religiously unaffiliated. Yet just one of 535 members of the new Congress is. That’s what the latest data from the Pew Research Center show on the opening day of the 115th Congress. The nation’s top legislative body remains far more male and white than the rest of the U. S. population as well, but religion is one of the more invisible areas where legislators in Washington simply aren’t representative of the people they represent. Only Arizona Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema admits to being ”unaffiliated,” which Pew defines as people who are atheist, agnostic or who describe their religion as ”nothing in particular.” That means only 0. 2 percent of Congress is unaffiliated, compared with 23 percent of U. S. adults. That group is   than any religious group in America, as Pew found in 2015. Meanwhile, nearly 91 percent of congressional members are Christian, compared with 71 percent of U. S. adults. Here’s a full breakdown of how Congress’ religious affiliations compare with those of the U. S. population: America’s nonreligious are young  —   and not politically organized, Why the massive gap? For one, religiously unaffiliated people tend to be young, and Congress just isn’t that young. In the 114th Congress, the average age for House members was 57 years old and for senators it was 61. (To a modest extent, this is a reflection of age rules: Senators must be 30 or older, and representatives have to be at least 25.) But groups that identify as ”nothing in particular,” agnostic and atheist  —   the three groups that make up the unaffiliated in Pew’s definition  —   are among the youngest ”religious” groups in America. So it may be that once Americans start electing more millennials to Congress, there will be a greater share of nonreligious people elected as well. In addition, younger Americans tend to have much lower voting rates than older people. That may also contribute, though the logic requires a couple of leaps  —   if this means the (relatively young) religiously unaffiliated population isn’t voting as much, and if the religiously unaffiliated are more drawn to likewise unaffiliated politicians  —   that could also help explain the lack of ”nones” in Congress. Likewise, the inverse is true: If older (and more religious) Americans are voting for more religious politicians, it means less room for the nonreligious ones. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, the unaffiliated Sinema is also relatively young for a congressional member at 40.) One more potential reason unaffiliated people aren’t in power: Not being affiliated often also means not being politically cohesive. ”They may be unaffiliated they may be atheist they may be agnostic . .. but they’re not part of some club,” said Margie Omero, a Democratic strategist at Purple Strategies, to NPR in 2015. ”You could certainly argue that evangelicals are not monolithic in terms of their policy beliefs, but there’s no denying that there’s more of an organization around organized religion than there is around disorganized atheism.” Atheism doesn’t poll well, It’s true that Americans remain at least somewhat open to atheist officeholders. In one regular polling question, Gallup asks Americans what types of people they would (or would not) vote for as president. For example, 91 percent of Americans say they would vote for a Jew and 81 percent say a Mormon.   percent of Americans would vote for an atheist. That’s not only a majority but a record high for atheists. Then again, it’s very low compared with Jews and Mormons (and Christians in general, who have made up all of the presidents to date) and the numbers altogether suggest that America’s nonreligious have a long way to go before they become mainstream as politicians. That 58 percent put atheists next to last on Gallup’s list, above socialist (at 47 percent) and on par with Muslim (60 percent). Not only that, but atheist is still far more of a minus than a plus for voters. According to one 2014 Pew poll, just over half of Americans said that knowing a presidential candidate was atheist would make them less likely to vote for that candidate only 5 percent said ”more likely” (the remaining 41 percent said it ”wouldn’t matter”). It’s not exactly ”nones” (atheists are only one subset of unaffiliated Americans) and it’s a question about voting for president, but it at least sends a message: Being nonreligious is still not a big selling point for many voters."
"Updated at 1 p. m. ET, Turkish authorities made multiple arrests Tuesday as they search for the person who attacked an Istanbul nightclub in the early hours of New Year’s Day, killing at least 39 people. A lone gunman shot his way into the Reina nightclub, which was packed with holiday revelers. Police arrested two foreign nationals who they described as suspects at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport, according to the   Anadolu news agency. They reportedly searched the pair and took them to police headquarters in Istanbul. ”The country remains on high alert, especially at transport hubs and border crossings,” NPR’s Peter Kenyon in Istanbul reported. The two arrests follow earlier media reports Tuesday  —   which were later reversed  —   that police had identified the suspected gunman at the Reina nightclub. The   TRT World news network showed images of a passport from Kyrgyzstan belonging to someone it identified as the suspected gunman and named that person, as Peter reports, but the broadcaster stopped showing the passport page shortly after without explanation. (We have since removed that name as well from this post.) Police later denied that the passport was linked to the shooting, as Peter reported. He added: ”The Hurriyet newspaper says police detained a woman in the town of Konya who’s described as the wife of the main suspect in the attack. According to the paper, she told police her husband never showed any sympathy for ISIS, which has claimed responsibility for the attack.” Turkish authorities have released a ”selfie” video purportedly showing the gunman walking along a city street. Turkish authorities did not say when the video was recorded or how they obtained it. Peter reported: ”The claim of responsibility by ISIS prompted Turkey’s deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus to say Turkey’s response will be to step up military attacks against ISIS in northern Syria. ”That escalation appears to have already begun. The military tells the   Anatolia News Agency that Turkish attacks have killed at least 18 ISIS fighters in the past 24 hours, and at least 150 ISIS targets have been hit by airstrikes or tank and artillery fire in recent days.” Police have conducted raids in Istanbul neighborhoods, Peter reported, and 14 people were being held for questioning in connection with the attack, in addition to the pair from the airport."
"When   Miranda was a teenager in the 1990s, he liked to make eclectic mixtapes for his friends. In those cassettes, he experimented with the rise and fall of energy in music: A musical theater number might play after a   song, only to be followed by an oldie or an obscure pop song. It was through mixtapes that he could bridge the gap between two seemingly opposing passions  —   Broadway and rap. ”I think I learned more about writing scores for Broadway by making mixtapes . .. than I did in college,” the actor, composer and lyricist tells Fresh Air’s Terry Gross. In 2008, Miranda’s first musical, In The Heights, won four Tony Awards, and in 2016, Hamilton  —   a   infused retelling of the Founding Father’s life  —   won 11 Tony Awards and a Pulitzer Prize. Though Miranda stepped away from his Hamilton role in July, he remains busy with other projects. He wrote several songs for the Disney animated film Moana, and he’s preparing to star in a film sequel of Mary Poppins. Looking ahead, Miranda says he doesn’t feel pressure to duplicate or exceed the success of Hamilton. ”If you think in terms of topping, you’re in the wrong business,” he says. ”I remember getting that question after In the Heights. ’It’s your first musical and you won the Tony, how are you going to top it?’ I’m like, ’I went from broke substitute teacher to Broadway composer. I will never make a leap that big in my life again.’ ” On what it was like to play Alexander Hamilton every night  It was an enormous challenge to do that show every night, and yet who to blame but myself? I wrote the part! And it was also the most thrilling roller coaster every night. You know, I got to fall in love, I got to win a war, I got to write words that inspired a nation. Getting to go through that experience, it’s something I’ll never get old of, which is why I really tried to downplay my departure as much as possible, because I don’t think I’m remotely done with it. On Donald Trump’s tweet calling for the theater to be a safe place after the Hamilton cast read a statement directed to Vice   Mike Pence, who attended a performance soon after the election, Here’s where I agree with the  : The theater should always be a safe space. . .. I think one of the reasons Hamilton has been embraced by people of every stripe on the political spectrum is that theater is one of the rarest places where we still come together. You may take a totally different conclusion from Hamilton than I do, based on your ideology and your politics and your life experience, but we all sat in a room together and we watched the same thing, and that doesn’t happen anymore. As you can see from this election, we have our own sets of facts based on who we listen to. Which news organization gets our business determines the facts that get in our head. So I think one of the things that makes theater special is, first of all, it’s one of the last places you put your phone away, and second of all it’s one of the last places where we all have a common experience together. So to that end, I agree with [Trump’s comment]. I don’t agree with his characterization of what we did. I think anyone who sees that video sees [actor Brandon Victor Dixon] silencing the boos . .. from the audience itself, who . .. nine days after the election are still working through that thing. I can’t speak to that, but I know that Brandon quieted the boos and made a plea to lead all of us. I don’t believe there’s anything remotely resembling harassment in what we’ve done. On the life he dreamed of as a kid  I have two wonderful, supportive and very practical parents who are like, ”You’re really talented and really creative. You should be a lawyer,” because there’s a safe path there. I knew I was never going to be a lawyer. I knew that I wanted to make movies, and I wanted to write shows. On his love of Disney musicals growing up, I had the great joy of being 9 years old when The Little Mermaid came out, and I went and saw that three times in the theater. Then I dragged my parents back and my family back to see it a couple more times. I don’t know why it changed my life as much as it did. I think Sebastian the crab had a big amount to do with it  —   the fact that this calypso number happens under the water just knocked my socks off when I was a kid. It had this power over me. I would perform that thing  —   I would jump up on my desk in fourth grade and sing that song. Then I had the good fortune of being a kid during that really kind of amazing run of musical animated films. It’s Little Mermaid, followed by Beauty and the Beast, followed by Aladdin, followed by The Lion King. That’s an incredible run. And what’s been exciting is animation has changed so much. There’s this incredible Pixar golden age, and really golden age from all these other studios as well, and it feels like we’re in another one of those where musicals have a seat at the table. You’ve got Tangled, you’ve got Frozen, next to Inside Out, next to Zootopia, and it’s exciting to be a part of that tradition again. On the music that influenced him as a teenager  My sister is as responsible as anyone for giving me good taste in music. I remember stealing her copy of Black Sheep’s A Wolf In Sheep’s Clothing and learning ”Engine, engine number nine, on the New York transit line.” I think that’s probably the first rap song I really worked hard to memorize in sixth grade, but then also Naughty by Nature and Queen Latifah. The music you love when you’re a teenager is always going to be the most important to you, and I find that it’s all over the score of Hamilton. . .. These are all New York, East Coast, ’90s rappers, and that’s when I was a teenager. On   between the Latin American neighborhood he grew up in and his school with affluent white kids  If you want to make a recipe for making a writer, have them feel a little out of place everywhere, have them be an observer kind of all the time . . .. I won the lotto when I got into Hunter  —   to get a great, free, public school education sort of saved my family, and I was aware of it. I was aware that I was at a school with kids who were really smart. And I also had friends in the neighborhood who went to the local school, and I remember feeling that drift happen. . .. The corner that I lived on was like this little Latin American country. It’s one in which the nanny who lived with us and raised us, who also raised my father in Puerto Rico, never needed to learn English. All of the business owners in and around our block all spoke Spanish, and yet I’d go to school and I’d be at my friends’ houses on the Upper East Side and Upper West Side and I’d be the one translating to the nanny who spoke Spanish. So it’s interesting to become a Latino cultural ambassador when you’re 7."
"Opening punches were thrown in what one top Democrat today called ”the first big fight” of the new congressional year  —   the promise by   Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. President Obama met with Democrats on Capitol Hill while Vice   Mike Pence sat down with Republicans, as each side prepared for the skirmishing in the days and months ahead. Asked what advice he gave Democrats in the   meeting about the legacy program that bears his name, Obama responded, ”Look out for the American people.” It was likely Obama’s last visit to the Capitol before the inauguration of his successor. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama told the lawmakers he wished he were in their place. ”The word he used was ’envy,’ ” Earnest said, ”for the opportunity they have” to fight GOP repeal efforts. Pence told reporters that Trump will sign executive orders on his first day in office to begin implementing the repeal of Obamacare, saying it was ”the first order of business.” The incoming administration, Pence said, is working right now on ”a series of executive orders that will enable that orderly transition to take place even as the Congress appropriately debates alternatives to and replacement of Obamacare.” He did not offer any specifics on what those orders would entail. He said Republicans will be taking a ”  approach” with a combination of executive and legislative actions. The new leader of Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer of New York, said GOP lawmakers seek ”to rip health care away from millions” of Americans, ”which will create chaos.” In his short, prepared statement, he repeated the word ”chaos” four times. Schumer said Democrats in both the House and the Senate are united in their opposition to Republican attempts to ”make America sick again.” House Speaker Paul Ryan said Republicans asserted, however, that there would be ”an orderly transition, so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families,” which he said are currently ”struggling” under Obamacare. But replace it with what? Ryan offered no specifics, except to insist Republicans do ”have a plan to replace it. We have plenty of ideas to replace it.” But House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, addressing reporters after hearing from Obama, said Republicans don’t have the votes for a replacement plan. Pelosi blasted an approach that some Republicans have discussed, that would repeal the ACA but delay its effect to give lawmakers time to come up with a replacement. She called the strategy ”an act of cowardice.” Trump himself weighed in today via his preferred method of communicating, tweeting that ”Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster” and ”Don’t let the Schumer clowns out of this web.” He warned that ”massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight  —   be careful!”"
"Desmond Tutu, South Africa’s former Anglican archbishop and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, recently celebrated his 85th birthday with an interesting message: He wants the option of an assisted death.  Tutu has largely retired from public life, but is still considered the moral conscience of South Africa for his leading role in the fight against apartheid. Some were taken aback when Tutu said he wants the option to end his life when he chooses. ”As a Christian, I believe in the sanctity of life, and that death is a part of life,” Tutu said in a recent video. ”I hope that when the time comes I am treated with compassion and allowed to pass on to the next phase of life’s journey in the manner of my choice.” An assisted death is currently illegal in South Africa. The Supreme Court of Appeal reaffirmed that stance in December when it struck down a lower court’s ruling that granted an applicant the right to an assisted suicide. Tutu, who has lived with prostate cancer for decades and has been in and out of the hospital in recent years, says he supports efforts around the globe to legalize the procedure.  ”I pray that politicians, lawmakers and religious leaders have the courage to support the choices terminally ill citizens make in departing Mother Earth with dignity and love,” he said. Tutu made that video for advocacy groups that support      laws. At the St. Alban’s Anglican Cathedral in the capital Pretoria, the organ starts to play as parishioners file into the   stone church, which sits among tall government buildings. Musima Gwangwa, who is attending the service, says Tutu’s leadership in ending apartheid, and the stances he has taken on human rights around the world, serve as a model that Anglicans like her should try and emulate. ”He’s more than an icon for us,” she says, adding that she supports his position. Not all parishioners agree. For Richard Botha, the archbishop’s decision is a confounding one. He calls Tutu a global elder and someone who is willing to call out leaders for poor judgment. But Tutu’s support for assisted death does not comport with Botha’s religious beliefs. ”I won’t remember him for that. I will remember him for his credentials and his human rights struggle,” says Botha.  Tutu has largely stopped giving interviews and declined NPR’s request. But he’s been making his feelings known in editorials in which he described as ”disgraceful” Nelson Mandela’s final days before his death in 2013. He described how Mandela, widely known as Madiba, was used as a political prop in photo ops, despite being unable to communicate. ”It was an affront to Madiba’s legacy,” Tutu wrote in The Guardian newspaper in 2014. He went on to argue that South Africa needed to revisit its laws regarding a person’s right to die. South African judges wrote in their recent ruling that they would welcome action by Parliament, meaning the legislature, and not the courts, should determine whether assisted death will be permitted in South Africa. Advocates for assisted death could take the case to the Constitutional Court.  Whatever the outcome,    advocates say Tutu’s support for the issue can guide conflicted people across the globe. ”It helps to hear a person who has dedicated his life to religion, and about whom there’s no question they are deeply religious, say there’s no incompatibility in religious faith and medical aid in dying,” says Barbara Coombs Lee, who leads Compassion and Choices, a group that lobbies for assisted death in the U. S."
"If you’re looking for a diet plan that suits your lifestyle, a new list of rankings from U. S. News  World Report has you covered. Most dieters are familiar with commercial plans such as Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig  —   both of which continue to make the magazine’s list for top diets. But a range of options offer fresh approaches, including the MIND diet, the   diet (a     diet) and the Ornish diet  —   which is ranked top for heart health. The annual rankings list includes 38 different diets, all of which have been evaluated by a panel of doctors, nutritionists and other health professionals. ”Each profile is an exhaustive look at what it’s like to be on each plan,” says Angela Haupt, assistant managing editor for health at U. S. News. The diets are ranked in categories, from ”easiest diets to follow” to ”best diets overall” to ”fastest weight loss.” The   diet makes the cut in the fastest   category. The diet was developed by a nutrition scientist at the University of Toronto. ”It’s a   spin on the Atkins diet. It calls for 31 percent of daily calories to come from plant proteins, 43 percent from plant fats and 26 percent from carbs,” explains Haupt. The claim is that dieters can lose 8 pounds a month, while improving blood levels of triglycerides, cholesterol levels and blood pressure. ”Our experts say it’s superior to Atkins and good for fast weight loss, but it can be tough to follow, since guidance is scarce. You’re largely on your own, which can deter some dieters,” Haupt tells us. Other   diets that rank high include the Ornish diet, based on the plan developed by Dr. Dean Ornish. This diet approach is touted as a way to reverse diabetes and heart disease. The diet moved up a notch from the 2016 list. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, soy products, nonfat dairy, as well as some ”good fats that contain   fatty acids,” according to a description on the diet’s website. The Mediterranean diet retains a top spot as well. As the reviewers explain in the diet’s profile: ”There isn’t ’a’ Mediterranean diet. Greeks eat differently from Italians, who eat differently from the French and Spanish. But they share many common understandings.” A   Mediterranean diet pyramid was developed by Oldways, a nonprofit in Boston, working with researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health. The U. S News reviewers point out: ”The    secret [of a Mediterranean diet] is an active lifestyle, weight control, and a diet low in red meat, sugar and saturated fat and high in produce, nuts and other healthful foods.” Another bonus: A little red wine with meals is not frowned upon. If keeping your noggin sharp is a high priority, the MIND diet  —   which is ranked No. 3 on the list of Best Diets Overall  —   combines the DASH diet approach (which was originally designed to help people control high blood pressure) and the Mediterranean diet. According to the U. S. News reviewers, MIND  —   which was developed by researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago  —   focuses on foods that influence brain health. So what are some changes from last year’s rankings of Best Diets? The vegan diet moved up to No. 16 on the Best Diets Overall List. (Last year it was No. 21.) And SlimFast dropped from No. 15 on the list of Best Diets Overall down to No. 20. Two other diets that slipped in the rankings: Atkins fell on the Best   Diets list, and Biggest Loser also slipped in the Best Diets for Healthy Eating category. The paleo diet hangs on. It’s ranked 36th out of 38 in the Best Diets Overall category. The main knocks against it: Reviewers say the produce aisle and meat counter tend to be expensive, and the diet can be hard to follow while dining out. Reviewers note that dieters will need to get accustomed to ordering breadless sandwiches and skipping many other menu items that contain grains and dairy. Also noted: Alcohol is not part of a true paleo diet. Why the changes in rankings? ”Our expert panelists reviewed and rescored each diet, and their scores vary each year based on program changes, new research and general evolution of thinking in the diet and nutrition space,” Haupt tells us."
"Rex Tillerson,   Donald Trump’s nominee for U. S. secretary of state, is severing his ties with Exxon Mobil. The former chairman and CEO is in line to receive a $180 million retirement package. Tillerson, who has spent his entire career at Exxon, would have reached mandatory retirement age in March. The company announced that it will pay him in cash for the more than 2 million shares he would have received over the next 10 years and that the money will be transferred to an independently managed trust. If confirmed as secretary of state, Tillerson also has committed to sell the more than 600, 000 Exxon shares he currently owns. The deal means he will give up about $7 million dollars, compared with what he would have received had he retired in March as planned. The deal was worked out to comply with federal ethics rules. Tillerson has promised not to return to the oil and gas industry for 10 years. If he violates the agreement, he would forfeit all the money in the trust, which would be given away to charities chosen by the trust manager. All this is meant to reassure senators that Tillerson would not be unduly influenced by Exxon Mobil if he were to become America’s top diplomat. He still has an uphill battle for confirmation. Democrats have yet to agree on confirmation hearings tentatively set for Jan. 11, and senators on both sides of the aisle will likely question Tillerson about his close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. As Exxon Mobil CEO, he was opposed to U. S. sanctions on Russia, which got in the way of his company’s project with Russian energy company Rosneft to drill in the Arctic. Tillerson met Wednesday with the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin, who has been an outspoken critic of Russia and a supporter of sanctions. The Maryland senator said he had a ”candid” discussion with Tillerson.  ”Russia is not a friend of the United States,” Cardin told reporters outside his office, saying he thinks ”that is a strong bipartisan message you will hear during the confirmation process.”   Cardin also said he didn’t have time to review Tillerson’s divestment and ethics plan before the meeting and that he still wants to see three years of his tax returns. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker,  . has argued that there’s no need for that. He said the agreement that Exxon Mobil’s board reached with Tillerson to comply with conflict of interest requirements is ”all tidied up and done.” Sens. Marco Rubio and John McCain, both Republican members of the foreign relations committee, also have expressed concerns about Tillerson’s views on Russia."
"Dylann Roof delivered his opening statement in a South Carolina courtroom Wednesday, as the penalty phase of his federal trial got underway. Roof, who was convicted last month of murdering nine black churchgoers, will be representing himself as jurors weigh whether to give him the death penalty or life in prison. His remarks were brief, focused only on defending his decision to dismiss his lawyers for this phase of the trial. He said it’s ”absolutely true” that he chose to represent himself so that his lawyers would not present evidence of mental illness. ”The point is I’m not going to lie to you,” Roof said. ”There’s nothing wrong with me psychologically.” He did not address his crimes or the prosecution’s opening remarks against him. U. S. District Judge Richard Gergel approved the    white supremacist’s request to serve as his own counsel after a second hearing on his mental competency. The request for    —   and its approval  —   came over the protests of Roof’s own lawyers. Roof has said he will not call witnesses or experts to the stand during this phase of the trial. Still, earlier this week, Gergel laid out strict rules for Roof’s conduct while acting as his own lawyer. ”In an order, the judge detailed how Roof can behave while in court,” Alexandra Olgin of South Carolina Public Radio reports. ”He cannot approach witnesses, the jury or the bench and has to give opening statements from behind a podium.” Roof killed nine parishioners at Charleston’s historically black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church on June 17, 2015. In a confession taped shortly after he was taken into custody, Roof made plain his racial motivations, adding: ”I am guilty. We all know I’m guilty.” It took less than three hours last month for the jurors to concur. They found him guilty of charges ranging from murder and attempted murder to obstruction of religious belief and damage to religious property. Federal prosecutors, who are pursuing the death penalty, delivered a much longer opening statement. Assistant U. S. Attorney Nathan Williams focused his remarks on those who died in the shooting, and on what he called Roof’s lack of regret. Central to the latter argument is a journal that prosecutors say Roof wrote in after his arrest. In the journal, excerpts of which were presented to courtroom reporters, Roof allegedly says that ”  have to pay for what they’ve done.” ”I created the biggest wave I could,” Roof allegedly wrote. ”I did all I can do, now it is in the hands of my brothers.” In concluding his remarks, Williams warned that the testimony to come will be worse than what jurors have heard yet: ”It will be heartbreaking,” the prosecutor said. The penalty phase of the trial resumed Wednesday with prosecutors calling their first witnesses. The prosecution plans to call up to 38 people as witnesses and experts during this phase of the trial, according to The Associated Press. This is not the only trial that Roof is facing  —   and not the only possibility for capital punishment. ”After the federal proceedings,” reports NPR’s Debbie Elliott, ”Roof is scheduled to be in state court early next year on murder charges that also carry the possibility of a death sentence.”"
"A crowded commuter train crashed into a bumper block and partially derailed as it pulled into Brooklyn’s Atlantic Terminal on Wednesday morning, according to N. Y. officials. The FDNY says at least 103 people sustained    injuries. ”It appears that the train was heading into the station, at 10 or 15 miles per hour, and did not stop,” WNYC’s Stephen Nessen tells our Newscast unit. ”It hit a bumper block the front two cars were lifted off the tracks. One of the rails actually pierced the bottom of the front car.” The crash happened during peak morning commuting time, when between 600 and 700 people were on the Long Island Rail Road train originating from Far Rockaway, Queens, Nessen adds. ”People just went flying,” passenger Donette Smith told The New York Times. ”Bodies were everywhere. It was very scary.” The injuries reported so far have been largely minor: WNYC reports that the most serious is a broken leg. The chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Thomas F. Prendergast, told the Times that most of the injuries were sustained when the train ”came to an abrupt stop after crashing into the bumper block at the end of the track.” Nessen says it’s still unclear what caused the train to crash: ”Trains pulling into the station do automatically slow down but it is up to the conductor to hit the brake finally for the train to stop and in this case, it appears that didn’t happen. Investigators are still looking into what happened.” Prendergast also suggested that responsibility may lie with the train’s conductor. ”At that speed, it’s pretty much the locomotive engineer’s responsibility to stop the train,” he said, according to Reuters. Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters at the scene that it could have been worse. The crash is drawing comparisons to September’s train crash in the nearby Hoboken Terminal in New Jersey, which killed one person and injured more than 100 others. The Times quotes Cuomo as saying that the train in the Hoboken crash ”was coming in much faster, did much more damage, hurt many more people.”"
"Amid this week’s firestorm over Republicans’ attempt to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics (and subsequently, backpedal on that attempt) you may have seen this chart floating around the Internet. It depicts data from Google Trends about Americans’ search interest in learning who their congressional representatives are, with a pronounced spike around 9 a. m. Tuesday. The Hill reported this on Tuesday, with the The New York Times later referencing the trend. The conclusion some are drawing is that people looked up their representatives, then called them to complain about the ethics issue, and that the groundswell of support got Congress members’ attention. And, indeed, some Congress members reported that these phone calls did influence them. But there’s a   issue with this data, and with all Google Trends data  —   the problem of scale. While there’s a ”spike” here, there’s no way to tell how big it is without comparing it to other popular  —   or unpopular  —   search terms. Depending on what you’re comparing it to, that spike is little more than a speed bump. Here, for example, is the ”who is my representative” search compared to searches for ”Obamacare” in the U. S. over the past week. The spike nearly disappears here  —   as of 9 a. m. Tuesday, ”who is my representative” registered at 7 on this chart, compared to 60 for Obamacare. But then, maybe that’s not fair. Obamacare is a really big topic in the news right now. Let’s try a Google search term that’s still   but with less mass appeal, like infrastructure. The    spike is a bit more apparent here, but it’s still dwarfed even by searches for the relatively nonsexy topic of infrastructure. The really striking comparisons come when you compare this ”spike” to searches for   topics. How about a newly released, poorly reviewed movie? What about a certain pop superstar who recently gave a catastrophic performance on national TV? OK, so the spike for Mariah Carey happened a couple of days earlier, but you get the picture. It’s true that Google Trends data can say something about what people care about, and that can be   in a democracy where politicians are theoretically supposed to represent those cares. For example, researchers reported in October that Trump searches outstripped Hillary Clinton searches. They subsequently concluded that ”this could be evidence that Mr. Trump is doing better than the polls project.” But when that data is presented without a reference point, it can overstate the importance of a particular search trend. In fact, to get a term that has comparable volume to the Congress member search, you have to get creative and do a lot of random Googling. As it turns out, searches for ”who is my representative” are roughly equal to searches for a 1990s trend that people have mostly forgotten. So searches for ”who is my representative” spiked, surpassing Beanie Baby searches for the first time in . .. well, a long time. None of this is to say that this spike didn’t matter lots more people than usual did Google their Congress members’ offices, and anecdotal evidence suggests that there was an increase in people calling their Congress members. But it is to say that Google data on only one search term can misrepresent the size of a phenomenon. Yes, plenty of people were Googling their Congress members this week. But plenty more were watching that Mariah video."
"Louisiana is losing its coast at a rapid rate because of rising sea levels, development and sinking marshland. Officials are trying to rebuild those marshes and the wetlands, but much of the coast can’t be saved. This makes Louisiana’s history an unwitting victim. As land disappears and the water creeps inland, ancient archaeology sites are washing away, too. Richie Blink was born and raised in Plaquemines Parish, La.  —   way down south of New Orleans along the Mississippi River. Now he works for the National Wildlife Federation. When he was a kid, his dad showed him a special place in Adams Bay, where they’d go fishing. ”We would come out of the floodgates and my dad would say ’Head for the Lemon Trees! ’” Blink says. What’s locally known as the ”Lemon Trees” is a stand of weathered old trees on a grassy tuft of land. It’s a   landmark for fishermen, but Blink says they would rarely stop there to hunt or fish because it’s a sacred Native American site. ”The legend goes that you were always to bring some kind of sacrifice, so somebody left some lemons for the ancestors,” Blink says. And those grew into big trees with   lemons. But as land was lost to the Gulf of Mexico, saltwater made its way into the freshwater marsh, killing off the trees and other plants. The trees stand like skeletons on the edge of this scrappy,   island. Waves beat against the dirt, washing it away, exposing shards of ancient pottery. ”You can see, it’s just everywhere . .. there’s just shards of it all over the place,” Blink says. ”This is earthen pottery made by natives. This site is in the process of being destroyed. It only has a few more years left.” This ancient Native American site is an important archaeological find. It’s one of many historic sites being forever lost to the Gulf as rising seas and saltwater intrusion eat away at Louisiana’s fragile marshes. Two sites like this are lost each year. When Blink saw how fast the land was eroding he decided to find an archaeologist and ask for help. That led him to Brian Ostahowski. Ostahowski says he gets a lot of calls like this, at least once a month. People who say: ” ’I have a great archaeological site in my backyard,’ ” Ostahowski says. ”And chances are they usually do.” So he hopped in a boat with Blink and went out to the ”Lemon Trees.” ”Richie wasn’t lying,” Ostahowski says. ”This is actually a very, very important archaeological site.” Based on the pottery and soil, Ostahowski says native people lived at the site 300 to 500 years ago. The pieces of broken pottery are probably from an ancient trash pile, called a midden. There could even be human remains there. ”You’re talking about a whole ceremonial center that could tell you about lifeways, or the change of lifeways, that’s going to be completely gone within 10 years,” he says. ”It maybe took 300 years of occupation there.” Three hundred years to build it  —   and in just 10 years it could be erased. Ostahowski took samples of the soil for radiocarbon dating. Unlike the usual   archaeology dig, Ostahowski wants to excavate the mound as soon as possible and study the pottery shards and oyster shells. But the truth is, there just isn’t much time. ”We’re talking about different ways that we can come up with kind of an emergency action, or emergency excavations,” Ostahowski says. He wants to learn more, like how long people lived there and how many different occupations there might have been. These details could help fill gaps in our understanding of the prehistoric Plaquemine culture, which includes tribes that lived on the lower Mississippi before Europeans came. For Blink, it’s more than ancient history at stake. It’s personal history, where he grew up. He honors that in his own way, like two weeks ago when he brought out some lemons. Under a windswept tree, on top of the small mound, a handful of dried up lemons sits in the shade."
"Murmuration refers to the phenomenon that results when hundreds, sometimes thousands, of starlings fly in swooping, intricately coordinated patterns through the sky. Maybe you’ve seen a murmuration video before. But this one is especially beautiful. It was shot earlier this month in Wales, at Cosmeston Lakes in the Vale of Glamorgan, and posted on Facebook by the BBC Cymru Wales. Why do I love this short video so much? It’s all about science. Just how do the starlings manage to fly in such an amazingly coordinated way? A few years ago, George F. Young and his colleagues investigated starlings’ ”remarkable ability to maintain cohesion as a group in highly uncertain environments and with limited, noisy information”  —   a nice description of what goes on in a murmuration. Going in, Young et al. already knew that starlings pay attention to a fixed number of their neighbors in the flock, regardless of flock density  —   seven, to be exact. Their new contribution was to figure out that ”when uncertainty in sensing is present, interacting with six or seven neighbors optimizes the balance between group cohesiveness and individual effort.” Young et al. analyzed still shots from videos of starlings in flight (flock size ranging from 440 to 2, 600) then used a highly mathematical approach and systems theory to reach their conclusion. Focusing on the birds’ ability to manage uncertainty while also maintaining consensus, they discovered that birds accomplish this (with the least effort) when each bird attends to seven neighbors. In following this role of seven, then, the birds are part of a dynamic system in which the parts combine to make a whole with emergent properties  —   and a murmuration results. That’s just incredibly cool. Also, starlings are essentially an invasive species in this country. They were famously introduced to North America at New York City’s Central Park in the 1890s by Shakespeare enthusiasts who wanted all the bird species ever mentioned by Shakespeare to inhabit this continent. With starlings, they certainly succeeded: 200 million of these birds now inhabit North America. They aren’t welcomed by everyone. As the Cornell Lab of Ornithology puts it, starlings in the U. S. are ”sometimes resented for their abundance and aggressiveness.” In this Scientific American piece, they’re even called a ”menace.” The murmuration video invites us to see them with fresh eyes.

"Armed men reportedly attacked a jail in the Philippines, killing a guard and allowing more than 150 prisoners to escape. The attack took place at the North Cotabato District Jail in Kidapawan, a city on the island of Mindanao, just after 1 a. m. local time on Wednesday, according to the BBC. It added that ”authorities suspect the gunmen are linked to Islamist separatist groups.”   newspaper The Philippine Star reported that the strike was carefully planned: ”Superintendent Peter Bungat, provincial jail warden, said the attack began with a power outage that plunged the facility into darkness, followed by heavy gunfire aimed at the buildings inside its fenced compound. ”Bungat said one of his subordinates, Jail Officer 1 Hexel Rey Desibo, was killed in the ensuing encounter with the gunmen who attacked from the rear of the jail compound. ’It was not a jailbreak. It was a planned rescue of certain detainees,’ he said.” The BBC noted that the 100 or so attackers were ”armed with rocket propelled grenades and snipers’ rifles,” and far outnumbered the jail staff of around 20 people. The broadcaster added: ”In the chaos following the attack, 158 prisoners were able to put a ladder against a back wall and escape. Many of the 1500 inmates at the jail are linked to the various Islamic insurgent group in Mindanao. The authorities are already blaming the attack on the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, a   faction which has refused to join the protracted peace talks with the central government.” A spokesman for the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters denied the group was involved in the attack, according to the Star. The assault was the third in 10 years at the Cotabato jail, the newspaper said. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, whose war on drugs has led to the deaths of thousands of people, hasn’t yet publicly commented on the attack and mass escape."
"Frenchman Robert Marchand set a new world record Wednesday when he cycled 22. 547 kilometers (about 14 miles) in an hour  —   at the age of 105. Wearing a purple and yellow cycling suit, pink helmet and yellow glasses, Marchand completed 92 laps at the Velodrome National, an indoor track near Paris that’s used for elite cycling events. According to The Associated Press, he set a new record for the   age group and received a standing ovation from people in the crowd, who chanted ”Robert, Robert” as he rolled to a stop. Still, he said he could have done better. ”I did not see the sign warning me I had 10 minutes left,” Marchand said, according to the AP. ”Otherwise I would have gone faster, I would have posted a better time. I’m now waiting for a rival.” For comparison, the U. K.’s Bradley Wiggins rode 54. 526 kilometers (about 34 miles) in 2015 and holds the record for the men’s hour, the BBC reported. ”I am not here to be champion. I am here to prove that at 105 years old you can still ride a bike,” Marchand said, per Eurosport. His   ride Wednesday was incredible, but Marchand’s entire life has been a series of singular events. The AP has this on his background: ”Marchand, a former firefighter who was born in 1911 in the northern town of Amiens, has lived through two world wars. He led an eventful life that took him to Venezuela, where he worked as a truck driver near the end of the 1940s. He then moved to Canada and became a lumberjack for a while. ”Back in France in the 1960s, Marchand made a living through various jobs that left him with no time to practice sports. ”He finally took up his bike again when he was 68 years old and began a series of cycling feats. ”The diminutive Marchand  —   he is 1. 52 meters ( ) tall and weighs 52 kilograms (115 pounds)  —   rode from Bordeaux to Paris, and Paris to Roubaix several times. He also cycled to Moscow from Paris in 1992. ”Ten years later, he set the record for someone over the age of 100 riding 100 kilometers (62 miles).” So what’s his secret? Marchand’s coach and friend Gerard Mistler told the AP it’s simple: He eats fruits and vegetables, doesn’t smoke, drinks wine only on occasion, goes to bed at 9 p. m. and exercises every day. Mistler, perhaps cognizant of the cloud of doubt that hovers over impressive cycling performances, told the news service: ”If [he] had been doping, he would not be there anymore.” As if this story couldn’t get any better, here’s some amazing photos of the feat."
"People think of black holes as nightmare vacuum cleaners, sucking in everything in reach, from light to stars to Matthew McConaughey in the movie Interstellar. But, in real life, black holes don’t consume everything that they draw in. ”They’re actually pretty picky eaters,” says Jedidah Isler, an astrophysicist at Vanderbilt University. She spends most days chipping away at one of the universe’s biggest mysteries: How do the huge, overactive black holes, known as quasars, work? ”They are billions of times the mass of our own sun,” she says. ”I like to call them ’hyperactive,’ in the sense that they are just taking on a lot more than an average black hole.” And these monster black holes tend to do something strange. They not only reject material, but they use it to put on a space version of a fireworks show, shooting out shredded stars and other things in a stream of light and charged particles. ”Think of them as cosmic water hoses that are spewing out all kinds of particles and light,” says Isler. These are some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed, causing chaos in their host galaxies. Theoretically speaking, if an unlucky planet happened to cross paths with one of those jets, Isler says, it would not be pretty. ”It would basically destroy the planet completely. It would completely eviscerate anything that got in its way,” she says. She added, ”You know, things are being eviscerated in space all the time. It’s part of what makes it fun.” Isler specializes in the subset of quasars that happen to have their jet streams of material pointed toward Earth. These are called blazars, or ”blazing quasars.” Telescopes built in the last decade, like NASA’s Fermi   Space Telescope, have spotted a few thousand blazars. But don’t panic. ”Thankfully, they are far enough away that they are not going to have any negative impact on us as human beings,” Isler says. One of the closest blazars is 2. 5 billion   away. ”But they do serve as really interesting laboratories to understand these really exotic systems,” she says. ”They are able to accelerate particles to 99. 99 percent of the speed of light,” Isler says. ”How does that happen? So, I’m interested in where along that jet do we get this acceleration, and what is the physical mechanism that is responsible for the acceleration of particles that we see?” By analyzing data from a large sample of blazars, she and her colleagues have found that some particles exhibit   acceleration closer to the black hole than expected, suggesting that differences in blazar jets occur because of an internal process, like turbulence, as opposed to a more consistent factor, like how quickly the blazars draw in material. If the scientists can figure out how these natural particle accelerators work, they may begin to understand the physical laws that guide these unusual black holes, and maybe a lot of other systems out there that are capable of pulling things in and flinging them out. ”That process happens at many different scales across the universe with many different systems,” Isler says. For example, when planets form, they pull nearby material into what are called protoplanetary disks. Sometimes, they shoot that material out in jets, too, though on a much smaller, weaker scale than blazars do. ”There may be some way that this process is universal in our cosmos,” she adds. Understanding supermassive, hyperactive black holes could be a first step in figuring that out."
"Several civil rights activists were arrested Tuesday night for staging a   at Sen. Jeff Sessions’ office in Mobile, Ala. to protest his nomination as U. S. attorney general. The   was staged by the NAACP and portions were broadcast live online. The NAACP has sharply criticized Sessions’ record on civil rights, voting rights and criminal justice reform. Six of the activists were apparently arrested, including NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks. The NAACP highlighted Sessions’ history with voting rights as a major factor in the protest. Brooks told The Associated Press that Sessions ”does not acknowledge the reality of voter suppression while mouthing faith in the myth of voter fraud.” He also noted that Sessions once prosecuted civil rights activists on charges of voter fraud. As NPR’s Nina Totenberg has reported, those charges were dismissed by a jury, and civil rights groups described the prosecution as attempted intimidation of black voters. The NAACP cited Sessions’ ”record of racially offensive remarks and behavior” as another reason the group objects to his nomination. As Nina explained in November, Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship in the ’80s. He was rejected by a   Senate after he acknowledged having made racially insensitive remarks and calling several civil rights groups  —   including the NAACP  —   ” .” He later denied making some of the remarks, which ”seemed to add a credibility problem to his troubles,” Nina wrote. After making public statements objecting to Sessions’ nomination, the NAACP turned to civil disobedience. Brooks tweeted on Tuesday that the activists with him in Mobile were prepared to be arrested for their protest. The   began on Tuesday morning at Sessions’ office in Mobile, Ala. the AP reports: ”Demonstrators refused a request by the manager of the building  —   which includes several other tenants in addition to Sessions  —   to leave when the building closed for the day at 6 p. m. Police could be seen on video footage . .. handcuffing the six protesters and [escorting] them to a police van. ” ’We all are aware of the laws of trespass. We are engaging in a voluntary act of civil disobedience,’ Brooks told the officers who arrived at the scene.” AL. com reports that ”according to Mobile County jail records all six of the arrested members have been charged with   criminal trespassing.” The   was part of a statewide protest against Sessions, Kyle Gassiott of Troy Public Radio reports for NPR. ”Sessions has five offices in cities across the state, including Birmingham, Montgomery, and Mobile, and at each of the five locations members of the NAACP held press conferences protesting his nomination for attorney general,” Gassiott says. Sessions was in Washington, D. C. as the protests in Alabama were unfolding, the AP writes. A spokeswoman for Sessions said in a statement that ”false portrayals” of Sessions ”will fail as tired, recycled, hyperbolic charges that have been thoroughly rebuked and discredited,” the AP reports. Meanwhile, more than 1, 200 law school professors have signed a letter urging the Senate to reject Sessions’ nomination. ”Nothing in Senator Sessions’ public life since 1986 has convinced us that he is a different man than the    attorney who was deemed too racially insensitive to be a federal district court judge,” the professors write, citing his prosecution of civil rights activists and ”consistent promotion of the myth of   fraud,” among other things. ”All of us believe it is unacceptable for someone with Senator Sessions’ record to lead the Department of Justice,” they write. Sessions’ former chief counsel, who is black, told The Washington Post that the ”smear campaign” accusing Sessions of racial insensitivity needs to stop."
"Vocalist Xenia Rubinos ended 2016 with a bang: Her album Black Terry Cat was singled out in     lists by NPR Music, The New York Times and Rolling Stone. That kind of recognition is a major deal for an independent artist with a     artistic vision. Alt. Latino first recognized that vision back in 2012, when we featured a track from Rubinos’ first   EP, Magic Trix. After we first heard Black Terry Cat earlier this year, we rushed her and her band into our office for a mesmerizing Tiny Desk concert that only hints at the magic of her live show. That’s what we’re always trying to do at Alt. Latino: find and then support artists whose vision and imagination stops you in your tracks and opens up new worlds of sounds and ideas. So when Rubinos and her band passed through D. C. while on tour recently, we asked her to bring some music so we could discuss art, life and the joys of subtlety. It’s a spirited conversation, and we can’t wait for the next one."
"Imagine being able to collect the DNA of a human ancestor who’s been dead for tens of thousands of years from the dirt on the floor of a cave. Sounds fantastic, but scientists in Germany think they may be able to do just that. If they’re successful, it could open a new door into understanding the extinct relatives of humans. Most ancient DNA is extracted from bones or teeth. Matthias Meyer of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig says you don’t need very much of the bone less than a thousandth of an ounce will do. But there’s a problem. Anthropologists hate to give away any of their precious bones. ”We’ve been recently trying to explore new sources of ancient human DNA,” Meyer explains, ”as the fossil record is very limited.” He and his colleagues began to wonder if maybe they didn’t need an intact bone at all. Many of these interesting bones come from caves. What if, over the millennia, some of the bones had just degraded into a kind of dust, and fallen to the floor of the cave. It would be easy enough to get at that dust. ”You just take a shovel with some dirt, and then you look for DNA,” says Meyer. He says other scientists have recovered DNA from a variety of species from the floors of caves. Meyer now has some of this ancient human DNA from cave floors, and he’s been able to begin analyzing it. But there are problems to solve before he can make sense of the data. He’ll have to develop methods to be certain that the DNA came from an ancient human bone, and not a more recent human cave explorer or some contaminating bacteria. And the DNA they’ll get will be in tiny snippets. Piecing together the big picture will be tricky. Meyer says they’re making headway with those issues. Now, let’s say you can get lots of DNA that you know comes from an ancient human ancestor. What do you do with it? Plenty, says Janet Kelso, a colleague of Meyer’s at the Max Planck Institute. ”We’ve initiated a project just this year to try and generate sequences from a large number of Neanderthals, to try to understand something about the Neanderthal population histories,” Kelso says. Even though they’re gone now, Neanderthals were in Europe and western Asia for more than 300, 000 years, she says. During that time the climate in those areas changed dramatically. At times glaciers covered a large chunk of the landscape. If archaeologists can get DNA samples from Neanderthals at various time points in their history, Kelso says, ”we can see how were they adapting to the environment. How did they differ over time? Can we understand what happened to them in the end? That may not be something you can tell from the sequence, but it would be interesting to try.” Another question is just how often Neanderthals and modern humans had sex with one another. ”Was this something that was happening relatively regularly over some time?” she and other scientists wonder, as they try to piece together what was happening during each era. ”Was it something that was quite rare?” Kelso says most modern human populations have at least some genetic connection to Neanderthals. But there are many questions about when and where Neanderthals made their contributions to the modern human gene pool. It would be pretty amazing if the answers came from dirt on the floor of caves."
"The machinery inside Conner Bottling Works doesn’t sparkle like it used to. In fact, everything and everybody in here looks like they could use a break. ”We are the last   independent bottler in the state of New Hampshire,” says Dan Conner, part of the fifth generation to work here. ”A hundred and   years, from start to today. Never shut down, never stopped.” Launched in 1863, the first Conners bottled only beer, but in the 1890s, the company branched out into sodas. During Prohibition, harder drinks were made out back, while a friendly sheriff reportedly looked the other way. And then in 1938, the company laid out $2, 400 for the Dixie, a new bottling machine manufactured in Baltimore that has more than earned its keep. ”They put it in here brand new,” says Tom Howcroft, the only   working inside the factory. ”It’s been in this spot ever since, working just about every day.” Watching soda get made is more pleasant than watching, say, sausage. Howcroft lines up the gleaming glass bottles, with each one rattling along toward the spigots. He knows it’s a scene right out of a sitcom. ”Laverne  Shirley, the one that a lot of people bring up, with the conveyor belt,” says Howcroft. The gleaming bottles move down the line, first passing under the syruper that deposits two ounces of cane sugar and flavoring. Then, a stream of carbonated water, followed by the cap. ”Which happens with a big clang,” Howcroft says. The bottles then get a quick rinse from a tiny sprinkler. After they dry, they get a label, and finally, a taste test. ”It doesn’t taste anything like Coke, doesn’t taste anything like Pepsi,” says Howcroft. ”Like a traditional cola.” Traditions rolls deep here at Conner, and that’s thanks in part to the current owner, Tom Conner, who started working here ”when I was old enough to walk across the driveway from the house there. You didn’t have a choice back then.” Child labor rules have changed, and so have the economics of soda making. For starters, there’s not much local competition. ”At one time there were 60 bottlers in New Hampshire,” says Tom Conner. ”And we just happen to be the only ones left.” That ability to hang on has started paying off. The company’s line of sodas, sold under the name Squamscot Beverages, are now carried in more than 600 stores around the country. The Squamscott is a    river that runs through southeastern New Hampshire, as well as the name of the Native American tribe that settled in the region. Customers can choose from 27 different flavors, including root beer, cherry cola, fruit bowl and ginger ale. There are even some   options, much to Tom Conner’s chagrin. ”I don’t care for it. I know people like it. Some people have to drink it, and we make it. And let it go at that,” he says. During the holidays, the biggest demand is for Squamscot Beverages’ limited edition Mistletoe Mist, which is only available for about a month, unless it runs out sooner. It’s a family recipe Tom isn’t about to reveal. ”My parents used to take a mixture of different flavors, and they’d pour it into a punch bowl whenever they had holiday parties. And then we thought we’d just pour it into the bottle, cap it and call it something good,” he says. Mistletoe Mist is pinkish, citrusy and not really all that seasonal. But like a good punch, it goes well with whatever else is kicking around. ”Rum is good with it, vodka is good with it. But you can put anything you want in it,” he says. Everything in moderation, he cautions, though he ignores any concerns that too much soda is bad for your teeth. His smile reveals a mouth full of pearly whites, all his own. ”Well, most of them. You know, a couple broke off, had them fixed. But [my son] 40 years old, never had a cavity,” says Tom. ”So tell a dentist that.” After showing off his grin, his warehouse and the delivery truck, there’s one last item to see on the Conner family property. ”We can walk out back and see the solar system,” he says. Tom’s not talking about the celestial bodies that twinkle down upon his soda operation. Instead, it’s the 156 solar panels that power the entire factory. They’re big on tradition here at Conner Bottling, but are happy to update things if it makes financial sense. This story aired on New Hampshire Public Radio."
"An Israeli military court has convicted a soldier of manslaughter for shooting and killing a Palestinian assailant who was already incapacitated. The shooting happened in the occupied West Bank in March of 2016, and was captured on camera. The judges found that    Sgt. Elor Azaria acted in cold blood when he shot and killed Abdel Fattah   NPR’s Joanna Kakissis reports from Jerusalem: ”  had been shot and wounded after stabbing an Israeli soldier. Eleven minutes later, Azaria shot the motionless   in the head. ”A human rights activist filmed the killing. The video went viral. ”Many Israelis say Azaria was justified because he feared   might have been wearing an explosive belt. But Azaria’s superior officers say his actions contradict the army’s ethical standards.” On Wednesday, as three military judges announced that Azaria had been found guilty, hundreds of Azaria’s supporters outside the army base where the trial took place chanted ”God is with him,” Joanna reports. The case has been deeply polarizing in Israel, The Associated Press reports. It’s rare for an active member of the Israeli military to be charged with manslaughter. The AP reports: ”The verdict caps a   saga that has deeply divided the country. Defense officials have criticized Sgt. Elor Azaria’s conduct, while large segments of the Israeli public, along with members of the nationalist ruling coalition, have rallied behind him. ”In delivering her verdict, Col. Maya Heller systematically rejected all of Azaria’s defense arguments, saying ’the fact that the man on the ground was a terrorist does not justify a disproportionate response.’ ” Azaria is set to be sentenced on Jan. 15, according to the AP."
"”Dogs are better than human beings,” wrote Emily Dickinson, ”because they know but don’t tell.” That sentiment comes to mind when considering Emily Bitto’s debut novel, which showcases a dazzling, gabby and ultimately doomed collection of stray human beings. Assembled under one bohemian roof in 1930s Australia, most of these characters tell all to a fault. But one, an adolescent girl named Lily, sees all but keeps her mouth firmly shut  —   until she comes to narrate this book. Framed as a memoir drafted in 1985, when Lily has grown to maturity, The Strays invites readers into a world that is by turns disturbing and magical. The   art scene in   Melbourne burns white hot. Painters find themselves characterized as decadents in the newspapers and do their best to live up to the reputation. A canvas of riotous and erotic oils, the creative ferment comprises the narrative backdrop of The Strays. In the foreground is the story of two young girls who fall deeply in love and create an intensely private relationship amid the adult chaos that reigns around them. From the day they meet as    in grade school, narrator Lily adores Eva Trentham. The   exotic Eva lives with her parents Evan and Helena and two sisters in a grand heirloom of a house surrounded by rambling, sumptuous gardens. Lily assesses the sharp differences between the Trentham household and the boring, bourgeois,   suburbia where she has been raised by her utterly conventional mother and father Helena and Evan love their daughters, but that does not preclude them from partying nightly in front the kids. Helped along by generous doses of ”reefer,” as Bitto refers to marijuana throughout, the rolling revelry also features toothsome feasts, nudity, moonlit trysts and far too much wine. The     father of the clan takes a notion to defecate in the garden with everybody watching, which given the outrageous milieu is about par for the course. Lily is gobsmacked by the goings on. The adults are too feckless to shield their offspring, neglecting to send the young ones off to bed when it gets late. The girls themselves grab whatever stimulant they can get their hands on. Our narrator acclimates herself ”to being invisible, to being secretly in love with the people I lived with every day.” And the strays keep arriving, painters who move in with their slim suitcases, their brushes, oils and ”turps” (turpentine)  —   and their ambitions. Bankrolled by Helena’s inheritance, the Trentham property increasingly functions as a   arts commune. As a    Lily sees her future ”unfurling in the sunlight.” Taking up writing, secretly, as a voyeur, she finds herself ”learning the habit of attention, of noticing the world in all its ravishing detail and complexity.” The adolescent journals form her personal mode of   and eventually become the foundation for the ”memoir” that the grownup Lily presents in The Strays. ”Sometimes,” Lily tells us, ”I felt myself to be a dog under the table, scrounging after dropped morsels. I was sly and skulking like a dog has to be.” Word pictures which elevate the ordinary to exquisite appear throughout Bitto’s novel, appropriate to a book that focuses so much on the glory of art: ”The air there smelled of dry bush, gum leaves and wet clay, like the heavy blocks we used in pottery class, our teacher slicing them to pieces with a string tied between two clothes pegs.” It’s all too wonderful to last, of course. Eva, who prides herself as a young teen on a   dive from a cliff into the local quarry, suddenly grows up, engages in truly bad behavior, and distances herself from her crestfallen buddy Lily. They had shared a bed, with limbs entangled, ”an intimate, entwined existence.” With precise and graceful turns of phrase, Bitto reveals the bond of passion between the two girls, which seems unbreakable but inevitably snaps under all that can’t be said. And she delivers all of this with a grace and eloquence which rival that of the young friends’ bond. Jean Zimmerman’s latest novel, Savage Girl, is out now in paperback.

"There are more than 80, 000 educational apps in Apple’s app store. It seems like a great way to encourage brain development and make your little one the smartest baby genius. But just sticking a tablet in your kid’s hands might not be as helpful. Sure, use the app. But it’s not a babysitter  —   you’ve got to help them use it, too. Several recent studies have looked at how young children learn from touchscreens. One study, published in Child Development, compared how   and    learned to build a   puzzle. Some children learned how to assemble the puzzle from a ”ghost demonstration”  —   meaning that, initially, the pieces moved by themselves on the tablet to show how it works. A lot of apps that are intended for young children often have some element of this ghost demonstration: Pieces move on their own or objects will move them. Other children had a person sitting next to them to move the puzzle pieces on the tablet. After they watched the demonstration, both groups of children were asked to complete the task on either a touchscreen tablet or a real puzzle that looked identical to the one they saw. The   and    who saw the ghost demonstration had a hard time replicating the task  —   but did well after they saw the human hand. Researchers concluded that having a human guide  —   often referred to as having social scaffolding  —   helped these young children learn. ”Simply having someone show them how to put that puzzle together, rather than the app showing it to them, allowed them to put that puzzle together themselves” explains Rachel Barr, a professor at Georgetown and one of the authors of the study. ”But taking away that person  —   taking away that scaffold  —   made their performance just look like they had never even seen it before.” Previous research from Barr found that the presence of a parent  —   more social scaffolding  —   increased a child’s ability to transfer knowledge from the tablet to a real object. I spoke with Barr and Laura Zimmermann, the study’s lead author who is now at the University of Delaware, about the takeaways for parents, teachers and app developers. Should we be surprised that   and    learn better from a real person than from a screen?  Rachel Barr: Learning from apps and connecting it to the real world is challenging for a really young child. When we watch children play with touchscreens, it seems so intuitive to them. It’s very easy for us to forget that they are just like any other tool. And just like any other tool, children are going to need to learn how to learn from them. The ease with which we use technology makes us forget that this is really a fairly complex tool. If we think about how many hours each of us as adults spend with technology each day, and if you just add that up over at least 10 years, this is thousands of hours that we spent learning how to use this technology. These babies are only 2 years old, so their amount of experience using the tools is relatively limited. The fact that they don’t just learn everything like magic from these tools means that they require someone to help them with this experience. Is this a plea to have adults interact with the apps their kids are using? Laura Zimmermann: In an ideal world, we would love for there to be joint media engagement. So: Having a scenario in which a parent or a teacher or a sibling or peer is   with the child, interacting, teaching and showing new things to each other. This is an optimal way to promote learning and that should not be downplayed at all. Typically, having another person present during these interactions with touch screens or while viewing television is really beneficial. The parent or teacher can take into consideration what their child knows and build on that  —   something that’s too complex for an app to be able to do. So rather than children interacting with a touch screen on their own, parents can provide support, to then boost their learning or help them transfer what they learned to the real world. They could also connect that information to something else that they have in their home. Barr: With   [it’s] giving the child a little bit of support. That can really help them to process. It’s no different than other learning situations. Technology seems to be able to do everything. But for a very young child, it’s just a tool just like any other. And they need to learn how to do it and the best person to help them may be a parent or older siblings. Can you give me a concrete example? What would this look like?  Barr: Let’s say there’s a show or an app game about a cat and you have a cat living in your house. When that image of the cat is on the screen, the parent can simply say, ”Oh that’s a cat just like ours.” So it’s not sort of   and guiding every single piece of the experience, but it’s providing that information at the key point. ”Here’s the cat. It’s like the cat in our real world.” Or, if they’re playing a game putting together pieces of a puzzle on an app, then afterward, the parent can say, ”Oh let’s get out a real puzzle and switch that out.” Or if they’re building a block tower on an app program, building it with them. And now, ”Let’s build some real blocks.” So it’s just really helping them make those connections that seem obvious to us, but really are more difficult for young children. It doesn’t have to be a whole lot, but the trick is to think about apps and the television more like you think about picture books.  That’s the ideal world. But that doesn’t always happen. Barr: Right. We want to be realistic. Zimmermann: There is going to be interaction without humans. That’s just the nature of our world. Kids are spending time using touchscreens. And if we want to promote the best possible learning, then we have to think about ways that we can provide this social scaffolding in some other form. That’s the way I approach it. I definitely agree that having a parent show a child something would be the gold standard. Very early in life, infants are capable of imitating different facial expressions or sounds, just by observing their parents. This isn’t a new idea, right?  Zimmermann: We know, from decades of work looking at social learning, that kids learn best from a human. Compared to a touch screen, compared to video. There’s real importance in terms of the social scaffolding. Barr: Exactly. It’s the same with books. There’s been a number of studies where we find the same thing. Parental support around   is highly beneficial for later literacy. Around television: Some support around the content, helping them bridge that gap between the 2D world and the 3D world is really helpful. And now these latest findings suggesting the same thing is happening with apps. So, if there’s not a human around, are there things that app developers can incorporate into tablet games to help replace or mimic the social scaffolding?  Zimmermann: App developers could provide information in the app that teaches children or gives them feedback if they’re right or wrong to help improve their learning. Maybe a special sound or other haptic feedback  —   which is a form of touch information, such as vibration. This addition is something that would allow kids to learn, ”Oh I’m doing something right, or I’m doing something wrong,” to help them achieve some type of goal. In our study we did not provide this feedback in the app. We also know from previous work that different factors like repetition can help facilitate learning and encoding of information. So building in things like repetition can be useful for young children. Barr: The really nice thing about technology is that it will repeat. So we know that if babies are able to see the same show again, or the same task, this does help them learn. Zimmermann: There could also be adaptive play  —   things like leveling and scaling. It may be the case that with the       in our study, this puzzle was pretty complex for them. So maybe we should have started with a   puzzle. And depending on either the age of the kids or their previous performance, the app could present information accordingly. So as the kid succeeds on a   puzzle, the app could move on to a   puzzle. The task could get increasingly more complex based on the kid’s individual performance. I also want to be clear that this leveling is not something we manipulated in this particular study, but it’s something that I think future work should look at. When making educational apps, we need to be careful, to go back to the basics. It should be the starting point for developers to ask: ”What do we know about learning and early childhood?” and then use that information to design new technologies. All this is not to say that there aren’t exceptional educational apps out there, but there’s a lot for parents and teachers to sift through. How could this apply to the classroom? Laura Zimmermann: Early educators often require children to transfer knowledge from a task that they learned in one context to another. One example of transfer learning is a teacher showing their students something online or in a video, and then asking them to do an activity in real life or with some   test. Another example, in a preschool or an early elementary school classroom, is children learning basic addition and subtraction with blocks from their teacher. Then later, being asked to transfer their learning to a math activity on a touchscreen for a   assessment. Touchscreen assessments can be very useful tools, but it may be important to consider how their children learn a new skill  —   on a touchscreen or with concrete toys  —   as it may influence how they demonstrate what they have learned.

"To what lengths would you go to stifle the thunderous snorts and   growls of a spouse or roommate, just so you can get a good night’s sleep? Dozens of   devices crowd the market, ranging from slightly absurd to moderately torturous. ”Some of them are more medieval than others,” says Dr. Kim Hutchison, associate professor of sleep medicine in the department of neurology at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Ore. And some of the devices, she says, even have some basis in fact. ”When you sleep, the back of your throat relaxes. That narrows your airway and, as you’re breathing in, it causes it to vibrate,” explains Hutchison. So, many   products are aimed at opening up that airway, or the tunnels that lead to it. For example, you can buy hollow nose plugs that, instead of closing the nostrils, prop them open. ”If you have a deviated septum or something like that, those could help open up your nose and decrease snoring,” says Hutchison, but they won’t help everyone because ”most snoring appears in the back of your throat.” Other devices are designed to force sleepers to turn on their sides. ”Sleeping on your back makes your tongue block your airway a little, sort of like the skinny part of a balloon, when you let air out of it,” Hutchison says. So some devices combine straps and pillows that make sleeping on your back uncomfortable  —   or poke you if you roll over. There are also chin straps aimed at repositioning your jaw in a way that opens the airway. They might work for some, says Dr. Richard Schwab, director the Pennsylvania Sleep Center. But one chinstrap on the market covers the wearer’s entire mouth. ”A terrible idea!” says Schwab. ”You should never cover your mouth  —   you could choke.” Devices that gently poke and prod might help some snorers, says Hutchison. Eventually, some people do stop sleeping on their backs, to avoid being jabbed to consciousness. If that’s not annoying enough, there are more insistent devices: wristbands that send a little electric shock every time you snore. That seems drastic. But maybe not, if love is on the line. ”Snoring can create a lot of stress in a relationship,” Schwab points out. ”It’s an intermittent noise, so you can’t just get over it. People lose so much sleep, they can’t sleep in the same beds.” And snoring that routinely disturbs your partner could be a sign you should see a doctor, says Schwab. You might have sleep apnea, a disorder characterized by loud snoring and interrupted breathing. People with untreated apnea are at greater risk for high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke. A lot of apnea cases go undiagnosed, Schwab says. Consider prodding your snoring partner to see a doctor  —   even before trying some of the   remedies. ”If you treat the snoring and not the sleep apnea, you might never get evaluated,” says Schwab. And that’s important, because sleep apnea is treatable. Sleepers can wear masks linked to CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machines, which are very effective at keeping airways open and stopping the problem, he says. Sleep apnea can prevent the snorer from getting deep sleep many people say they feel more awake after using the machines. The whir of the machine can take getting used to at first, Schwab says, but it’s much quieter than snoring, so roommates usually love them. The bonus for the snorer: It doesn’t shock you awake. And it actually works."
"Even though most of the protesters fighting the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota have left, hundreds still remain here atop what is essentially a sheet of ice. One group of campers say there’s a change taking hold at camp, which was once overrun by thousands who felt a sense of excitement about the gathering. Byron Shorty, who lives on the Navajo reservation in Arizona, says now that the Army Corps of Engineers is temporarily halting pipeline construction, the protest camp is calm. ”I want to be here to reflect, and I want to be here to help clean up our abandoned campsites that I still see,” he says. ”And we’re in the process of cleaning those up and repurposing the things that people left behind.” Others, like Jacob Chamberlain, who came here from Scotland, are doing daily chores like chopping firewood. ”It’s not about taking selfies and saying that you were out here anymore. At this point, it’s about being hearty, surviving in the cold,” Chamberlain says. Earlier this month, the Army Corps said it would conduct a lengthy environmental review of this project, even as a fossil   administration is coming to Washington. Standing Rock council member Chad Harrison attended a recent meeting between tribes and the Trump transition team and was pleased that could even happen. ”My hope is that that’s an indicator of how serious he’ll be when it comes to Native American issues,” he says. But Doug Burgum, North Dakota’s new governor, is urging   Donald Trump to approve the project. He’s doing that even as he recently met with Standing Rock leaders in an effort to rebuild frayed relationships. A community divided, Demonstrations have caused gridlock, disrupted businesses and severely stretched police resources. ”It really kind of makes me sad when I see the picture that is being painted across the nation, this narrative that it’s this bad cop thing happening. And that’s not here in North Dakota. Not at all.” says Shelle Aberle of Bismarck, N. D. who runs a Facebook page supporting law enforcement. ”Our law enforcement are there to protect both sides.” Other residents back the pipeline opponents. The Unitarian Universalist congregation has supplied food to camp and shelter. In this protest, both sides often seemed to speak right past each other. Minister Karen Van Fossan says that should be changing. ”We aren’t often talking about the things that are on our minds, and now we really are,” Van Fossan says. Kay LaCoe hopes that’s true. The Bismarck resident recently called on residents to support businesses targeted by protesters. But soon after, hateful messages flooded her Facebook. She even received death threats and just wants a final decision on the pipeline to end all this tension. ”Whatever the government and the tribe and the energy companies decide to do with that pipeline, I’m good with it. Just give me my hometown back,” she says. But the legal battle over the pipeline will likely continue to play out in 2017 as North Dakotans grapple both with the protesters and the fallout from their continued presence.

"  Donald Trump has selected former Indiana Sen. Dan Coats to be director of national intelligence, according to a statement from   Donald Trump’s transition team. In choosing Coats, he is getting a veteran Washington establishment figure  —   a senator, former lobbyist and ambassador to Germany  —   with a rare distinction: being banned from Russia. Coats’ views on Russia after its annexation of Crimea, and his calls for stronger sanctions as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, landed him and other senators on Russia’s banned list. It’s a major difference with the   who has praised Putin and cast doubt on U. S. intelligence conclusions that the Russian government, sought to help   Donald Trump’s election chances. Coats even mocked Russia with a David   top 10 list on Twitter in 2014: Coats served as senator from 1989 to 1999 and again from 2011 to this year. (He did not seek   in November.) In between Senate stints, Coats served as U. S. ambassador to Germany during the George W. Bush administration and worked as a lobbyist. He was also asked by Bush to help his unsuccessful attempt to win Senate confirmation of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. Coats has been an outspoken critic of the Russian leader. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Coats wrote President Obama after Russia annexed Crimea in 2013, urging Obama to impose sanctions against a Russian weapons exporter. The senators argued the sanctions ”would send a powerful message to Putin,” whose foreign policy, they went on, has become ”increasingly belligerent.” Coats also sponsored an amendment to a Ukrainian aid bill in the Senate that would prohibit the U. S. government from doing any business with the exporter, a company called Rosoboronexport. Such actions, Coats said, ”would require our foreign partners to make a choice between America and Putin.” In 2014, Coats also called on organizers of soccer’s World Cup to move the tournament, scheduled for Russia in 2018, somewhere else. All of which won Coats the honor of being banned from Russia, along with five other lawmakers, including Armed Services Chairman and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, and three Obama administration staff members."
"Updated at 2:15 p. m. ET, Intelligence agency leaders repeated their determination Thursday that only ”the senior most officials” in Russia could have authorized recent hacks into Democratic National Committee and Clinton officials’ emails during the presidential election. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper affirmed an Oct. 7 joint statement from 17 intelligence agencies that the Russian government directed the election interference  —   and went further. ”We stand more resolutely on that statement,” Clapper said during a Senate Armed Services hearing with the intelligence chiefs into the politically charged issue. Clapper noted that the intelligence officials would not dive into many more details at this hearing, deferring to a broader, unclassified report on the election interference to be released next week. Committee Chairman John McCain,  . said there is no national security interest ”more vital to the U. S. than the ability to hold free and fair elections without foreign interference,” and that ”every American should be alarmed by Russia’s attacks on our nation.” ”We will ascribe” a motive for the Russian cyberattack in the upcoming report, Clapper said. He wouldn’t say Thursday what it is, but it has been widely reported that the intelligence agencies agree that Russia was trying to get Donald Trump elected. Clapper also said he will ”push the envelope” to make much of that report unclassified without jeopardizing sources or   details. ”The public should know as much about this as possible,” Clapper said. In addition to Clapper, testifying before the committee were Defense Undersecretary Marcel Lettre and Adm. Michael Rogers, commander of the U. S. Cyber Command of the National Security Agency. All three will be leaving their positions at the end of the Obama administration. One of the first questions from McCain was about the involvement of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks published emails  —   from the account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta  —   that the intelligence community says were hacked by the Russians. Assange has denied the Russian government gave WikiLeaks the emails. McCain asked Clapper if Assange had any credibility. ”Not in my view,” Clapper said, adding that Assange ”has put people at risk” with revelations about U. S. intelligence gathering. ”I don’t think those of us in the intelligence community have a whole lot of respect for him,” Clapper said.   Trump, however, has openly questioned whether Russia was involved in the hacking, pointed to errors the intelligence community made over the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and has appeared to back Assange in tweets. Clapper also said there is a difference ”between skepticism and disparagement” of the intelligence community. Trump has taken to Twitter, referring to ”Intelligence” and its officials in quotations. Clapper also testified that there is no evidence the Russian hacking changed vote tallies ”or anything of that sort.” He did say, however, there is no way of gauging the impact of Russia’s actions ”on choices the electorate made.” McCain asked Clapper if the Russian   constituted ”an act of war.” Clapper responded that constitutes ”a very heavy policy call,” which, he said, ”I don’t think the intelligence communities should make.” But he did say what was done carried ”great gravity.” Clapper added that Russia deployed more than just cyberattacks in its effort to disrupt the election, calling it a multifaceted campaign. ”The hacking was only one part of it,” he said. ”It also entailed classical propaganda, disinformation, fake news,” which he said was still going on. There was a fair amount of talk about rocks and glass houses, with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina calling the Obama administration’s response to the hacking, a set of limited economic sanctions, just ”a pebble.” ”When it comes to interfering with our election,” Graham said, ”we better be ready to throw rocks.” Sen. Thom Tillis,  . C. noted the U. S. has also attempted to interfere in other nations’ elections. ”We live in a big glass house,” Tillis said, ”and there are a lot of rocks to throw.”"
"The Republican Party has embraced   Donald Trump’s positions on immigration, trade, the deficit and conflicts of interest, but when it comes to Russia, Trump and his party are not even close to being on the same page. Trump has repeatedly and consistently expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin and has refused to accept intelligence community findings that Russia hacked Democratic Party emails during the campaign. That puts him at odds with almost every other Republican in Washington, D. C. On Wednesday, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told CNN he is mystified by Trump’s feelings toward Russia. ”What bothers me is that   Trump seems to get the Chinese for what they are the Iranian agreement is bad, he understands that he understands the threat we face from ISIL and he understands we can’t let the North Koreans build a ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] to attack our homeland,” Graham said. ”When it comes to Russia, he seems to have a blind spot. And I’m completely perplexed, because the Russians are undermining democracy throughout the entire world they’re taking land owned by others by force they did hack into our political system they’re doing it to other political systems, and they need to pay a price.” Vice   Mike Pence seemed to reinforce Trump’s effort to undermine confidence in the intelligence community. During a press briefing with House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday, Pence referenced Trump’s upcoming briefing with the intelligence community. ”We’ll be looking at the facts and the information,” Pence said. ”But I think, given some of the intelligence failures of recent years, the   has made it clear to the American people that he’s skeptical about conclusions from the bureaucracy, and I think the American people hear him loud and clear.” But Trump has gone beyond skepticism. He has sided openly with WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange, a fugitive from justice and someone most Republicans consider an enemy of the state. Ryan, the highest ranking Republican on Capitol Hill, told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that he didn’t share Trump’s approval of Assange. ”I think the guy is a sycophant for Russia,” Ryan said. ”He leaks he steals data and compromises national security.” According to Molly McKew  —   an expert on information warfare and a   consultant who has advised the governments of Georgia and Moldova  —   the   community can’t quite figure out Trump’s unwavering devotion to the Russian line. But theories abound. ”I think the discussion in the region and intelligence services that deal with Russia,” McKew said, ”is that his behavior looks like someone who may be compromised or may be concerned about something and nobody knows what that is  —   if it’s financial ties or financial leverage, if it’s something more than that. I don’t know. I think there’s a lot of different things. I think there probably are   relationships with Russians and Russian oligarchs that we don’t understand, that we don’t see.” Former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, a Trump supporter and a harsh critic of Putin, argues, though, that people should give Donald Trump a chance. ”I don’t think the rubber has met the road on this yet,” said Bolton, who is reportedly under consideration for a job in Trump’s State Department. ”It’s one thing to exchange niceties and compliments before a president actually takes office. It’s another when you confront concrete Russian behavior. That’s the real test.” Bolton said the   will draw his conclusions once he receives his full briefing by the intelligence community Friday. What those conclusions will be will send an important signal to Republicans on Capitol Hill, and to the Russians, who, McKew said, are also unsure about the new disruptive  . ”I think they’re as nervous about Trump as the rest of us,” she said. ”And I think that’s potentially a very big opportunity for Trump if he chooses to use it. I don’t know what happened in the election. I don’t know what his relationship with Russian financial interests or others are. None of us know any of that. What we do know is he will be the American president very soon. And if he wants to operate as a man defending our country’s interests, he needs to have a smart, aggressive Russia policy that limits what Russia is doing to us and exposes what that is.” That’s why the Friday private briefing for Trump is so important. His reaction to what he hears will be the first clue about whether the new president wants to stand up to Putin when he works against the interests of the United States."
"For a revolutionary, Deepali Vishwakarma is more quiet and reflective than you might expect. She’s in her 30s, small, with a round face that holds intense brown eyes and a shy grin. Vishwakarma is a lay counselor in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India  —   a   community member who goes out daily to fight what novelist William Styron once called a ”howling tempest in the brain.” She’s part of an effort by the Indian nonprofit group Sangath to provide mental health treatment to poor people in India and to show that people with much less training than a psychiatrist or psychologist can deliver effective care. Vishwakarma had 40 hours of training for her role as a counselor. So her counseling is definitely revolutionary. And some mental health observers wonder if it might work in the U. S. But it’s a controversial approach. Critics say the use of lay counselors means that patients receive substandard care. Tell that to Vishwakarma. In a typical week, she may meet with 25 people, and in her several years as a counselor, patients who’ve stuck with her, as most have, have done well. The patients have been diagnosed with serious depression (or stress or tension, as it’s more often called in India) or alcoholism, and every so often, someone with schizophrenia. She’s been trained to listen and to assign specific tasks to her patients. She might tell someone who’s feeling really low to go for a daily walk, or go out and play soccer, or work in the garden or listen to the radio. For depression, it means thinking about anything other than that paralyzing howling tempest. For schizophrenia, it means helping people, many of whom are on medication, adjust to living in society. Vishwakarma’s biggest challenge is educating her patients. Worldwide, most people with depression don’t seek help, and Deepali’s patients are no different. ”The people don’t know they have depression because they don’t understand what depression is,” she says. ”They come in seeking help for not sleeping, not eating. We tell them no, when we cure your mental issues the symptoms go away. Then they accept treatment.” To run this program, Sangath  —   that’s a Konkani word that means support or partnership  —   gets funding from the Wellcome Trust and other donors, And it’s not the only health care group trying this experiment. Several other countries, including Ethiopia, Nepal, South Africa and Uganda, are working on the lay counselor approach as well. Thirty or 40 years ago, the U. S. was, too. Lay counselors were going to be the next big thing for depression treatment. There were lots of pilot programs, and medical journals carried the results of research trials. Most of the old research showed that lay counselors were just as effective for depression as counselors with lots more education  —   sometimes even more effective. A 1979 review paper in Psychological Bulletin analyzed 42 papers and concluded   paraprofessionals got results ”equal to or significantly better than those obtained by professionals.” In a 1985 rebuttal in the same journal, the best the opponents could come up with was that professionals did just as well, but not better. In India, the establishment of lay counselors was pioneered by psychiatrist Vikram Patel and colleagues at Sangath. The idea sprang from something Patel saw in Zimbabwe, where he worked as a psychiatrist in the  . Community members were being trained to give care to people with AIDS. Patel figured that maybe the same approach could be used for people with mental illness. Years into the project, someone at Sangath came across the U. S. research and told Patel about it. ”It completely blew my mind,” says Patel. ”There was an entire research enterprise.” At first, Patel and his colleagues thought they were starting from scratch. They ran focus groups to gauge community acceptance and conducted small trials and then larger trials comparing lay counselors to ”enhanced traditional care”  —   basically, diagnosis by a doctor or health worker at a primary health center, medication if necessary, and sympathy from the staff, but not ongoing counseling. ”I was very happy to get the first set of results,” Patel says. And the results got better and better. The medical journal Lancet has just published  two large studies that confirm earlier research showing that lay counseling works and is  . Lay counselors get paid on par with staff workers at charitable institutions  —   a little lower than they might get in private industry. Psychiatrists or psychologists periodically review the charts the counselors are taught to fill out, and check in on the patients. Patel recalls being criticized at international meetings for advocating for substandard care. His standard reply: ”We need to wake up.” Lay counselors are effective, he says, and they address the lack of mental health workers that is so common in poor parts of the world. But Derek Summerfield, a psychiatrist with the National Health Service who has published papers on violence and mental health, says that the symptoms displayed by the patients  —   like anxiety and unhappiness  —   are the result of poverty and cultural differences, not depression. In a debate with Patel at McGill University, he said ”these are people who are struggling to find lunch for their children.” Patel’s response is that poor people can get depression just as rich people do, and they’re just as deserving of attention. Lay counseling could not work, says Patel, without people like Vishwakarma. The lay counselors come from the same community as their patients. They speak the same dialect, and they identify with their patients. The counselors start with at least a 10th grade education. Vishwakarma had been an ASHA, an accredited social worker. But she says she didn’t know anything about depression or schizophrenia before going to intensive   training. Today, Patel says, the challenges are figuring out how to scale up the program, which is currently funded by the Wellcome Trust and other donors, and how to make sure that a   program will produce adequately trained counselors. ”We’re no longer asking can we use community workers, we’re asking how do we deploy them,” says Patel. Right now community counselors are available in two states in India, and more are likely to come online soon. The Indian Parliament is considering a plan that promises mental health care for all, using primary health clinics  —   and lay counselors. That’s not the case in the U. S. What happened after that flurry of papers, says Patel, was that ”suddenly the trail goes dry, and from the 1970s onward the literature dries up.” Patel’s suspicion is that the professional community was threatened by the use of paraprofessionals with comparatively light training. He’s been careful in his work in India to avoid competing with psychiatrists and psychologists. Instead they do the initial diagnosis and help with the training program. The medical officer at Vishwakarma’s clinic says he very much appreciates the support of the lay counselors. ”Before, we couldn’t treat these patients,” says Dr. Wilfred Mirand. ”After the patients were successfully treated I became confident.” The approach has American proponents such as Alan Kazdin, former head of the American Psychological Association. ”Seventy percent of the people in this country who need psychiatric services receive nothing,” he says. That number comes from several studies, including two published in the Annual Review of Public Health and JAMA Internal Medicine. ”The truth is that today, we are not treating everyone in need, and we cannot do so if we insist on    therapy, at a clinic, with a mental health professional.” Kazdin is an expert on parenting but has been interested in lay counselors as a way of expanding access to care for years. So why no change? ”There’s no incentive,” says Kazdin. ”The individuals who suffer from mental illness are not the best lobbyists, and there’s no industry behind this.” Terry Wilson, a psychology professor at Rutgers University, says it’s always challenging to introduce a culture shift. ”The problem is professionals here are concerned or worried that lay counselors are not going to be able to provide the expert level of care that they’d want.” But he thinks lay counselors could catch on here. ”Change takes time,” he cautions. Meanwhile, Vishwakarma soldiers on. Recently she took me to visit one of her patients, a woman who wasn’t sleeping or eating well. The woman had suddenly felt a sense of loss that she thought would somehow kill her. Vishwakarma gave her homework. Every day pick a number from one to 10 that indicates her mood and write that number down. Read her ”smile cards”  —   yellow cards with positive sayings. Take time to sing and listen to music. Sometimes her patient picks devotional songs sometimes she opts for Bollywood tunes. Without Vishwakarma, the woman says, ”I would have only worsened.” The patient is still worried about finding money for school fees for her three young children. But she has found ways to cope with her worries. To show me, she takes out her cellphone and plays a devotional song. With her    daughter at her side, she looks at Vishwakarma, hums along softly with the tune and smiles. Reporting for this story was supported by The Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting."
"  Donald Trump sat for a deposition on Thursday in a civil lawsuit related to his hotel in the Old Post Office building in Washington, D. C. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed to NPR via email. Even as Trump prepares to assume the presidency, he continues to have entanglements related to his   business dealings. A source close to the case confirms the videotaped deposition took place at Trump Tower in New York and lasted 90 minutes. The $10 million civil lawsuit, for breach of contract, was filed by Trump’s lawyers in August 2015 against celebrity chef José Andrés’ restaurant group, Think Food Group. Andrés pulled out of a plan to open an upscale restaurant at the hotel after   Trump disparaged Mexican immigrants. Think Food Group also countersued for $8 million. In countersuing, the restaurant group argued that Trump’s comments were hurting business: ”The perception that Mr. Trump’s statements were   made it very difficult to recruit appropriate staff for a Hispanic restaurant, to attract the requisite number of Hispanic food patrons for a profitable enterprise, and to raise capital for what was now an extraordinarily risky Spanish restaurant.” Trump’s lawyers had tried to avoid the deposition, arguing the   was ”extremely busy handling matters of very significant public importance.” But last week the judge in the case ordered Trump to sit for the deposition before the end of this week. While the civil case has dragged on for months, as recently as Thursday morning Andrés tweeted an offer to Trump for a way to settle the dispute. A number of lawsuits involving Trump and his businesses remain outstanding and are unlikely to be resolved before he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20. That could mean having a president in office who is subject to ongoing litigation, a potential major distraction for the leader of the free world. There is a pretrial hearing scheduled for May 17 in a case against another celebrity chef, Geoffrey Zakarian, who pulled out of a restaurant project in the Old Post Office as well. Andrés endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton during the campaign and called on Trump to apologize to Mexicans and every ”person he has insulted.” Zakarian told the Village Voice in November that he nixed the project ”because my buddy Donald, he f***** up. He opened his f****** mouth.” NPR’s Peter Overby wrote in more detail about both cases late last year. Despite Trump’s boasts that he does not settle lawsuits, he has settled several, including a   fraud case against Trump University for $25 million. There’s also a question as to whether Trump can hold the lease on the Old Post Office building once he becomes president. He doesn’t own the building but is leasing it from the federal government. The agreement contains a clause that could prove problematic for Trump: ”No member or delegate to Congress, or elected official of the Government of the United States or the Government of the District of Columbia, shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.”"
"  Donald Trump has suggested he may give his daughter and    some roles in his new administration, but a 1967   law makes doing so a lot more complicated. The law bars presidents from hiring relatives to Cabinet or agency jobs, although a federal judge has ruled that it doesn’t apply to White House staff jobs. Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, have played key roles in Trump’s campaign and his transition team and reportedly are preparing to move to a house in the Kalorama section of Washington, D. C. Either or both of them are also said to be considering some sort of White House job, perhaps in an informal or unpaid role. The   law was passed by Congress in response to President John F. Kennedy’s decision to appoint his brother Robert as attorney general, says Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. ”It was very controversial at the time. Lyndon Johnson in particular did not like that, and when he became president he helped shepherd this   law through the U. S. Congress,” West says. Not many presidents have sought to hire relatives since then, so the law hasn’t often been tested. But when President Bill Clinton appointed his wife, first lady Hillary Clinton, to head his health care task force, the move was challenged in court. A federal judge ruled that the law didn’t apply to White House staff jobs, making the appointment legal. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment from NPR, but spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway cited that ruling when she was asked whether Trump would hire his children during an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe last month. ”The   law apparently has an exception if you want to work in the West Wing, because the president is able to appoint his own staff,” Conway said. ”The president does have discretion to choose a staff of his liking.” But just because it might be legal for Trump to hire his own children doesn’t mean it’s good politics, West says. West warned that it could spark a public backlash, much as Kennedy’s appointment of his brother did. ”People might accept the fact that it was legal, but they would not necessarily view it as ethical or wise,” West says. Julian Zelizer, professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, notes that the   statute was one of a series of laws passed in the 1960s and ’70s, at a time of growing mistrust of the presidency. ”We shouldn’t forget why we have these [laws]. It was to try to purify the presidency to a certain respect, or to create more accountability in the people that they appoint,” he says. Americans need to know that presidents are not listening to people just because they’re related to them but because they’re the best people they can find, Zelizer says. Moreover, it can be hard for other staff members to say no to a president’s relatives, Zelizer says. ”And so you create an environment where people might be less willing to take on and challenge someone because they’re related to the president,” he says. Hiring the Trump children would also be complicated because they have played big roles in the Trump family businesses, he adds. ”If you load up the White House with family members, all of whom are working for this business, that problem will certainly not look good to many Americans. And the politics are as important as the law in this issue. How things look, how things appear matter very much,” Zelizer says. For Ivanka Trump and her husband, taking jobs in the White House would also come at some financial cost. Unlike Trump himself, they would almost certainly be subject to federal    laws, which would bar them from participating in decisions that would affect their financial interests. That could force them to divest themselves of some of their assets."
"Just before dawn Thursday, at Tokyo’s historic Tsukiji market, a familiar face walked away with the biggest fish in town. Kiyoshi Kimura won the first auction of the year at the market, just as he has for six years running. And to the winner go the spoils: a   Pacific bluefin tuna, which ultimately cost Kimura 74. 2 million yen  —   or about $632, 000. That comes out to more than $1, 300 a pound for Kimura, whose Kimura Corp. owns a restaurant chain called Sushi Zanmai. Still, it’s not the record for the seafood market’s annual first bluefin auction. That distinction also belongs to Kimura, who in 2013 bid a staggering 155. 4 million yen  —   which at that time came out to $1. 76 million. Every year, worldwide media hype attends the year’s opening auction at Tsukiji, which ”handled more than $4 billion in fish and produce in 2014” alone, according to The Wall Street Journal. NBC reports that it is the world’s biggest fish market. But conservation groups protest that attention should be paid to a different, and much darker, reality confronting Pacific bluefin tuna: the species’ dwindling population. ”People should be thinking about that when they see news about the auction,” Jamie Gibbon, officer for global tuna conservation at the Pew Charitable Trusts, tells the Guardian. In July, Pew called for a   moratorium on commercial fishing of Pacific bluefin tuna, citing a more than 97 percent drop in population from historic levels. The month before, about a dozen environmental groups petitioned the U. S. National Marine Fisheries Service to list the species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Conservationists argue part of the problem is that when fisheries catch Pacific bluefin tuna, they’re mostly catching juveniles who have not yet reached the age of reproduction. That practice has always been around, says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, but ”more fisheries specifically targeting juveniles started in the 1990s, increasing pressure on the juvenile population.” And even if the species gets an endangered listing in the U. S. as conservationists would wish, it’s not likely to make much of an impact on the species’ population worldwide. That’s because American fishermen don’t comprise a large portion of Pacific bluefin fishing worldwide, as Alistair Bland reported for NPR: ”Of the 37 million pounds of Pacific bluefin caught by fishermen in 2014, American fishermen caught just 2 percent, according to data provided by Michael Milstein, a public affairs officer with NOAA Fisheries. (Japan took about half and Mexico almost 30 percent. )” The Guardian estimates that Japan consumes 80 percent of the global bluefin catch. For now, the only major change looming for the Tokyo market’s annual New Year auction is its location: The city had planned to move the historic market to a new location to make way for a highway planned for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics  —   but the market was granted a reprieve when concerns were raised about soil contamination at the new site, which used to be home to a gas plant. The Tokyo government expects to have a clearer idea on the safety of the new site this year."
"Last year, NPR’s Ari Shapiro visited Toledo, Ohio, to talk to refugees settling there from Syria’s civil war. Recently, he returned to Toledo to check in on the community. Mohammed Al Refaai is a    butcher who fled Syria. He lives in Toledo, Ohio, with three other guys, who are also in their 20s, who decided they wouldn’t mind having a refugee for a roommate. In the year and a half since he moved in, he has learned English from the Americans including the lyrics to some Top 40 hits. In return, he taught them some of his favorite Arabic pop tunes. They generally avoid talking about more difficult things. But his roommates  —   Doug Walton, Andrew Trumbull and Johnny Zellers  —   made an exception during our recent visit to Toledo. While Refaai was at work, they talked about politics and whether he will ever be reunited with his family. ”Moh,” as they call him, won’t really talk about these things, Walton says. ”This is by far the most depth we’ve ever gone into it, and if Moh was here, we probably wouldn’t, because he doesn’t like the topic,” Walton says. Refaai’s story is atypical. He was the only one of his family allowed into the United States as a refugee. His siblings and parents are still in Jordan, waiting for approvals. They’ve been there since the family fled Syria in 2011. Refaai is now trying to get a Green Card so if they can’t come to the U. S. he can at least go visit them. The recent presidential election hit especially  —   and literally  —   close to home, Zellers says. ”We actually got a flier from Trump, and it had . .. three big issues,” he says. ”The third one was ’Stop the influx of dangerous refugees from Syria’  —   as . .. the biggest bullet point. I was like, ’No, we want more of ’em. . .. We have one, I have one in my house right now. . .. I can go say hi to him!’ ” The guys in this house lean conservative. They all take their Christian faith seriously. None of them voted for Trump it was a mix of Clinton and   votes. They didn’t even know who voted for whom until we all started talking about it. ”It is weird to have a vote in a situation that felt like we were voting for people who were helpless. Usually we vote on jobs or whatever, and so for me, I’m like, that’s not a big deal. I find a job. I’ll make things work, whoever gets elected  —   they’re not going to change things that drastically,” Trumbull says. The guys don’t own a TV, so on election night, they all went into Walton’s room and huddled around their phones with Refaai to watch the results come in. ”So we were all kind of together just like kind of hugging him and just kind of watching it all go down,” Walton says. ”He definitely kind of got sad a little bit just thinking of like, OK, maybe his family may not be able to like ever come here,” Zellers says. ”That’s like the biggest hope that he’s had like this past year. . .. Now Trump elected it’s like, oh, those chances go down like a lot.” An ”unusual” situation, Refaii is a butcher at a new Middle Eastern supermarket and restaurant in Toledo. When we met him a little over a year ago, he barely spoke any English. He had learned the terms that a butcher uses every day  —   chicken legs, chicken breast, steak, lamb  —   and that was about it. Today he looks confident. He doesn’t use an interpreter when he talks to us. He video chats with his family in Jordan about once a week. He shows them the snow on the ground in Ohio, and they tell him how proud they are that he’s learning English and working. ”I like it they come here, but I don’t know how. I need they be safe and close to me, my family, but I can’t do anything,” he says. ”I feel bad for they not with me, but I can’t do anything for help him.” We asked the State Department about Refaai’s situation. Just like a year ago, they told us they don’t comment on specific cases. But veterans of refugee work say his situation is not normal. ”This situation you’ve described is very unusual,” says Eric Schwartz, who ran the State Department’s refugee resettlement program earlier in the Obama administration. He’s now a dean at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs. He says once you’re over 21 like Refaai, your case is considered on its own. But even then, grown children are rarely separated from their parents and siblings. ”And it would be very unusual for them not to be departing and coming to the United States together,” he says. It might have just been an oversight. Schwartz says an immigration lawyer might be able to sort out what happened  —   but Refaai and his family don’t have one. [Editor’s note on Jan. 9: After this story was broadcast and published, Schwartz contacted NPR to note that hiring a lawyer is not required and that   refugee advocacy organizations often make case inquiries with the Department of State at no cost to the refugees themselves.] ”This is a program that involves so many tens of thousands of individuals that sometimes mistakes or problems do arise, and the way they get fixed is somebody asks about them and somebody presses them,” he says. Refaai fears that his window is closing as the days tick down to Trump’s inauguration. The office that issues Green Cards has told him to stop calling, and that has changed the way the other guys in this house think about their future. ”Before it’s just like ’Oh, Moh is here, his family will come and then I’m like, well, I’ll move on with our lives  —   we’ll all move away or get different jobs or, I don’t know, and then Moh will have his family. But now it’s like his family may never come,” Zellers says. Walton says Refaai won’t talk about that. ”He doesn’t even want to acknowledge that could happen because thinking about this family being broken up, that like leaves him lost in a sea in a way,” Walton says. ”But we don’t know what’s going to happen. So I don’t know what’s going to be asked of me as his brother, but I guess I’m just more aware that he may have more need for support than even he does now.”"
"Unexplained, short radio bursts from outer space have puzzled scientists since they were first detected nearly a decade ago. The elusive flashes  —   known as fast radio bursts, or FRBs  —   are extremely powerful and last only a few milliseconds. The way their frequencies are dispersed suggests they traveled from far outside our galaxy. About 18 have been detected to date. They’ve been called the ”most perplexing mystery in astronomy.” Scientists are still grappling with why these bursts happen. But researchers have now pinpointed the source of one series of the FRBs  —   to a dwarf galaxy billions of   away from Earth. And locating the source of the mystery bursts could hold clues to what is causing them, according to Shami Chatterjee, an astrophysicist at Cornell University. He’s the lead author in a paper recently published in Nature. Let’s talk quickly about one burning question: Could the source be aliens? Probably not, Chatterjee tells The  . ”Never say never, but we don’t think so. We can view this with physics that we know and understand.”   explanations involve a neutron star or an active galactic nucleus, though there are a slew of possibilities, he says. The story of this particular burst, called FRB 121102, took a wild turn when scientists found that its signal repeated. This immediately eliminated a number of theories about why it was happening  —   for example, it couldn’t be two neutron stars colliding. ”Because we know right away that it can’t be explosive. Whatever it is, has to survive this radio flash,” Chatterjee adds. The equipment used to detect FRBs is able to see only a tiny patch of the sky at any moment. The discovery that FRB 121102 repeated suggested that it was a good direction to point the detection equipment. ”If you go fishing in this spot in the sky, you might be more likely to get lucky than in other random spots in the sky,” Chatterjee says. In 2015, the team began using an interferometer  —   in this case, a network of 27 radio dishes called the Very Large Array that’s in New Mexico  —   which is capable of much higher resolution detection than other readings. ”It was a pretty intensive observational and computational challenge,” Chatterjee says. The interferometer captured data at 200 frames per second from this patch of sky, he says, resulting in a terabyte of data every hour that put a major strain on archival and computational resources. During the first 10 hours of recording this sliver of sky, they found nothing. They recorded 40 more hours  —   again, no bursts. Frustrated, the team also enlisted the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. This time, they got lucky. They captured nine radio images of bursts, allowing them to ”pin it down to an absolutely tiny patch of the sky” for the first time. In that patch of the constellation Auriga lies a dwarf galaxy a fraction of the size of our own, Chatterjee says, some 2. 5 to 3 billion   away. It’s worth noting that the sheer distance of the flashes’ origin makes ”catching it in the act” very relative, since the event that caused it happened billions of years ago. So what was that event? Chatterjee says there are many theories. It could be originating from an active galactic nucleus, which emits FRBs as blobs of plasma drift into its jets and are vaporized. Or it could be originating from a newborn magnetar  —   a neutron star with an extremely strong magnetic field  —   that is ”emitting these giant pulses as it spins.” It also could be the interaction between a magnetar and a black hole, or many other possibilities, he adds. A crucial question now, Chatterjee says, is whether all FRBs repeat like this one, or whether there are types that don’t repeat. ”They’re probably the same thing and we haven’t been lucky enough to observe the other ones repeating,” he says. ”But if not, hey, great, nature’s given us two fantastic mysteries instead of one fantastic mystery.”"
"There’s a new narrative solidifying in Washington:   Donald Trump distrusts the U. S. intelligence community because it’s been sounding the alarm on Russia’s interference in the November election. In turn, this feeds a growing sense of dread among U. S. intelligence professionals that the   and his inner circle will ignore or undermine the intelligence community at every opportunity. The intelligence community certainly has reason to be concerned. Trump’s goal to slash and restructure the CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence was reported by the Wall Street Journal Wednesday, the same day the   raised doubts about U. S. intelligence in a tweet citing WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. A day earlier, Trump elicited alarm after he tweeted disparagingly about a classified briefing he is due to receive this week. But it’s doubtful there will be a major conflagration between the president and the national security bureaucracy during the Trump administration. The intelligence community is likely to back down from a major conflict with its boss, the president, and its overseers, Congress  —   because the disincentives to upset one’s superiors are so numerous and ingrained. This is not the first time the intelligence community in general, or the CIA in particular, has faced scorn  —   or worse  —   from a president or  . Richard Nixon famously disliked the CIA and was skeptical of its analysis. Nixon once told his Director of Central Intelligence James Schlesinger, ”Get rid of the clowns. What use are they? They’ve got 40, 000 people over there reading newspapers.” Within three months, Schlesinger pushed out 10 percent of the workforce. Following the   Church Committee investigation of the CIA for spying on   War activists, President Jimmy Carter’s fellow U. S. Naval Academy classmate, Adm. Stansfield Turner, dismissed hundreds of agency employees in a mass firing dubbed the ”Halloween Massacre” of 1979. (Turner later reflected in his memoir, ”In retrospect, I probably should not have effected the reductions of 820 positions at all, and certainly not the last 17. ”) Yet the agency survived to fight another day. The intelligence community has traditionally served as a convenient scapegoat when policymakers’ decisions go south. There’s an old saw in Washington: In this town, there are only two possibilities: policy success and intelligence failure. We think of the Iraq WMD debacle primarily as an intelligence failure. And Trump’s communications staff certainly thinks so, as it resurrected the issue to dismiss a Dec. 9 Washington Post report that the CIA had assessed that Russia was trying to help Trump win the White House. ”These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,” the Trump statement said. But remember, it was a policymaker’s decision to actually go to war in Iraq. So the intelligence community has played this role of whipping boy before and will very likely continue to play it in the Trump administration. And there probably won’t be a showdown. People will grumble, but will go back to work. Most intelligence collection and analysis is a job as potentially interesting or humdrum as anyone else’s. Despite the classified nature of the ”industry,” people still collect data, type on computers, fill out forms and try to make sense of the world around them. One can often forget that the intelligence community is made up of professionals who lead regular lives. Sure, they hold   clearances, but they have mortgages and car payments, lawns to mow, children to take care of, vacations to plan. They are civil servants with a secure,   American lifestyle that would be jeopardized if they quit their jobs. That said, there may be some who could try to undermine Trump by leaking embarrassing documents and committing criminal acts in the process. Certainly in an industry where millions of people hold security clearances, there will be some who could try unilaterally to take action (how’s January in Russia, Edward Snowden?) to effect change or cause disruption. A few people might also just quit in protest. But those willing to do this to stick it to the president are few and far between. Most people will not throw away their life’s work. Still, there’s a large exception that may arise if the president asks the intelligence community to do something that is   illegal and immoral  —   say, commit obvious war crimes. On the campaign trail, Trump claimed that ”torture works” and said he favored tactics like killing the families of terrorists. He later appeared to   on torture after discussing it with his defense secretary nominee, Gen. James Mattis. But if he changed his mind again, it would, of course, be members of the military or the intelligence community who would carry out these deeds. And in such a case, all bets are off. Treat the intelligence community badly  —   well, that’s par for the course. But if the events of the last 15 years have taught this generation of intelligence professionals anything, it’s that one’s sacred honor might be sacrificed for reasons beyond one’s control. Assuming there is no   conflagration between the new president and the intelligence community, a slow degrading of our intelligence capacity during a time of unprecedented global challenges may be a more likely  —   and worse  —     outcome. The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, recently noted that right now, America is ”facing the most complex and diverse array of global threats that I’ve seen in my 53 years or so in the intel business.” Perhaps otherwise motivated intelligence officers with specialized skills will redirect their energies into other careers if they disagree with the direction of a Trump administration. The CIA publicly acknowledged in 2015 that it continues to struggle, despite numerous years of trying, to recruit and retain minority officers. If there’s, say, real   or   sentiment sweeping through the intelligence community because of the words and deeds of senior leadership, talented people will vote with their feet, ultimately damaging our   national security. So does this all end with a bang or a whimper? Or not at all? Clapper is confident, because of the intelligence community’s mission and professionalism, that it will be a ”pillar of stability” during the presidential transition. We’ll find out when the first national security crisis occurs under Trump’s watch. And if the past is any indication, a crisis (or two or three) will explode soon after he takes the oath of office.

"  Donald Trump continues to dispute the consensus of U. S. intelligence agencies that Russia used computer hacking to interfere in the 2016 elections. He does so even though other Republican leaders and analysts perceive a serious cyberattack that demands retaliation. If he persists in this posture, Trump may wish to rely on the precedent of previous presidents who entered the White House at odds with their own parties over a major issue in foreign relations. But can he find one? That’s a tough question. In recent decades, presidents have come to the Oval Office in something very much like lockstep with their parties regarding relations with Russia and other familiar adversaries. Presidents whose parties had their backs, Ronald Reagan, the predecessor Trump likes to cite as a model, came to office largely on a vow to get tough with Russia  —   then still the Soviet Union and making aggressive moves on several fronts (1981). In this stance, Reagan had the overwhelming support of his own party and from many Democrats as well. In fact, Reagan’s predecessor, Democrat Jimmy Carter, had canceled U. S. participation in the 1980 Olympics in Moscow to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Reagan’s successor, George H. W. Bush, in 1989 continued the pressure on the Soviets and was in office to see that regime replaced by a semblance of democracy in Russia. His term included the fall of the Berlin Wall and other symbols of what was long called ”the Red Menace.” The first President Bush did go to war, however, after Iraq invaded its neighbor Kuwait in 1990. But he had the backing of Congress, including nearly all of his own party and many Democrats as well. Foreign policy was not a big priority for President Bill Clinton, either as a candidate in 1992 or as a   president, but he had the backing of his Democratic troops when issues did arise, including the brief Kosovo War in the Balkans in 1999. George W. Bush took the oath in 2001 at a time when foreign policy was on a back burner in Washington. The terror attacks of that September changed all that, and Bush had the backing of both his own Republicans and most Democrats in sending troops to attack   in Afghanistan. Republicans were also strongly behind Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq, as were some (but by no means all) Democrats. After those wars had become quagmires, Barack Obama arrived in 2009 with a promise to recalibrate the ”War on Terror,” especially by winding down the U. S. presence in Iraq. His party was very much on board for this, although some differences on the details emerged over time. His desire for a ”reset” with Russia reflected the desire of Democrats generally to lessen global tensions and concentrate on domestic issues. A common enemy, Finding a precedent for Trump’s party schism does not get any easier looking at the decades right after World War II. Although the Soviets were a major U. S. ally in that conflict, tensions began immediately over the postwar map of Europe and the Soviets’ intensive covert campaign to steal secrets for a nuclear weapon. The tensions came to be known as the Cold War, and extended soon to the Communist regime that took over China in the late 1940s. In the presidential politics of the Cold War era, candidates in both major parties vied to be the most outspoken in their  . Republican Dwight Eisenhower was elected in 1952 vowing to ”go to Korea” to meet and defeat communist aggression there his former running mate Richard Nixon won in 1968 while uniting his party around his ”secret plan” to end the war in Vietnam. Both had solid backing from Republicans across the board. Democrat John F. Kennedy rallied his partisans in 1960 to close ”the missile gap” he said we had with the Soviets, and his former vice president, Lyndon Johnson, campaigned on his determination to stop communism in Southeast Asia in 1964 (after Congress, dominated by Democrats, gave him carte blanche to do so). Returning to the era between the first and second world wars, it is difficult to find much daylight between a newly elected president and his party on a foreign policy issue. Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover had few real disagreements with their Republican backers. Like them, Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected with a unified party preoccupied with the economy and social issues. In fact, if you plow your way through the rest of American history, you will be   to find presidents preparing their first inaugural addresses while engaging in a highly public dispute with their own party over the behavior of a foreign adversary. As a rule, international affairs have mattered to a new president when a foreign threat  —   real or perceived  —   has united that president’s party in support. No one expects a   to agree with his own party’s leaders on every issue. It would be especially surprising if that were the case with Trump, who entered the contest for the Republican nomination as an outsider and conducted his campaign largely on personal terms. Nonetheless, Trump and the GOP adapted to each other with notable success in the endgame of the 2016. Former rivals such as Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, and leaders who had refused to stump with Trump (including Ryan) expressed their intention to vote for him. In the end, even most of the GOP voters who had reservations about Trump came home on Election Day and voted a party ticket. They did it knowing there would be disagreements down the road. But they might not have expected them to come before the new president had even been sworn in."
"The halls of the Kiambu County Hospital just outside Nairobi are empty. This is normally a bustling place but on Thursday entire wings are closed. Only in the emergency room are there a scattering of patients. Moms with babies sit languidly on metal chairs. Men with broken bones and some with serious injuries are just hoping to be treated. But they probably won’t be seen by doctors. A doctor’s strike that began last month in Kenya has now entered its second month. Physicians at public hospitals want more money and better medical equipment, but the government says it can’t afford to meet their demands. The strike has left millions of Kenyans without proper health care and has also overwhelmed some of the country’s private hospitals. The nurses at the public hospitals are not on strike, so they’re doing whatever they can. They’re the ones running the ER. But a patient who needs complicated care and can’t afford a private hospital is out of luck. The only doctor I found at the Kiambu hospital is David Kariuki, who is on strike but showed up to perform his administrative duties. ”The current strike is about better working conditions for doctors, especially those within the public health sector,” he said. A doctor right out of school in Kenya makes about $10, 000 a year in the public health system. To earn more money, many of them are lured abroad or into the private hospitals that many Kenyans can’t afford. That means, Kariuki said, that ”the public health care system continues to be strained, because you have fewer doctors to see a growing population, so everyone would get overworked” and more stressed out. And it’s not like there were a lot of doctors on duty before the strike: 5, 000 physicians in the public sector serve a population of nearly 50 million. In the emergency room, I find Masa Mawili, who came to the hospital because of his foot. It was so swollen that it hardly fit in his sandal, and the swelling extended all the way to his calf. He doesn’t know what caused the swelling. He said he had already seen the nurses but they couldn’t tell him what was wrong with his foot. So he sat and waited hours in the hope that a doctor would show up  —   some of them have been working despite the strike. On Wednesday, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta met with the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union for hours. Late at night, his government put out an offer: Some doctors would get a more than 100 percent raise, others significantly less. The doctors are supposed to respond by Friday, but they seem determined to hold out for the 300 percent raise that the government agreed to in a 2013 collective bargaining agreement but has since walked away from. But it’s not just about the money. ”The CBA [collective bargaining agreement] once signed will make sure more doctors are trained to improve on service delivery,” the union tweeted. At the hospital I visited, some patients sided with the doctors but others took the government’s side. Paul Kagiri, whose   son was given the OK to go to college after a physical at the hospital, said that what the doctors are asking for is ”very, very, very high.” The government can’t afford to pay them. And there are reports of people who sought help at public hospitals and ended up dying. Right now, he said, it’s time to think about the wanjiku  —   the ordinary people. ”Only the wanjiku right now is suffering a lot,” Kagiri said. ”And instead of wanjiku suffering why [don’t the doctors give back to the public?”"
"The vaquita is a small porpoise found only in the northern Gulf of California, in Mexico. Today, the species is critically endangered, with less than 60 animals left in the wild, thanks to fishing nets to catch fish and shrimp for sale in Mexico and America. The animal is an accidental victim of the fishing industry, as are many other marine mammals. But a new rule that takes effect this week seeks to protect marine mammals from becoming bycatch. The rule requires foreign fisheries exporting seafood to the U. S. to ensure that they don’t hurt or kill marine mammals.  If U. S. authorities determine that a certain foreign fishery is harming these mammals, the fishery will be required to take stock of the marine mammal populations in places where they fish, and find ways to reduce their bycatch. That could involve not fishing in areas with high numbers of marine mammals. Fisheries will also have to report cases when they do end up hurting mammals. This is what American fisheries are already required to do under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). Up to 90 percent of seafood eaten in the U. S. is imported, most of it shrimp, freshwater fish, tuna, and salmon. The goal of the new rule is to ensure that seafood coming into the country didn’t harm or kill marine mammals. But can this new rule protect the vaquita? Zak Smith, a senior attorney with the Marine Mammal Protection Project at the Natural Resources Defense Council, thinks so. The vaquita is kind of a poster child for what happens when you don’t have this law in place,” he says. To understand the potential impact of the rule, Smith says, we should consider the laws that saved dolphins from tuna fisheries. For decades, dolphins  —   which swim with schools of tuna  —   were accidentally (and sometimes deliberately) killed by tuna fisheries. According to NOAA, over six million dolphins have been killed since the beginning of tuna fishery. Enacted in 1972, the MMPA required tuna fisheries to take measures to stop harming dolphins. Then, in the 1980s, the act was amended to ban the import of tuna from foreign fisheries that harmed dolphins. In 1990, the U. S. passed another legislation  —   the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act  —   that spelled out requirements for ” ” labeling on all tuna sold in America.  Smith says these laws have helped reduce dolphin deaths. But the new rule goes even further, he says, because it applies to all kinds of seafood and all marine mammals, not just tuna and dolphins. As an American consumer, ”I’ll know that anything I purchase in the U. S. met U. S. standards,” he says. A 2014 analysis from the NRDC estimated that hundreds of thousands of marine mammals are injured or killed every year by fisheries around the world. The U. S. government’s independent Marine Mammal Commission says unintentional encounters with fishing gear represent ”the greatest direct cause of marine mammal injury and death in the United States and around the world.” So the new rule could help protect many marine mammals worldwide, says John Henderschedt, the director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Fisheries Office of International Affairs. He says in some fisheries around the world, fishermen use nets that whales and dolphins easily get caught in. And some fishermen won’t take the time to make sure entangled marine mammals are released safely, he says. He adds that for some fisheries, the new rule will make them take stock of their marine mammal populations, and think about how to protect those animals for the very first time. The new rule is good for American fisheries too, says Ryan Steen, a lawyer representing the Hawaii Longline Association. ”If U. S. fisheries are going to be subject to the standards that are set by the [Marine Mammal Protection Act] then I think it’s only fair that their foreign competitors would also be subject to the same standards if they’re delivering fish into U. S. markets,” he says. ”It’s the fair thing to do and it’s the right thing to do.” But implementing the new rule could be tricky, cautions Linda Fernandez, an environmental economist at Virginia Commonwealth University. For example, the World Trade Organization could object to any bans on imports from a seafood exporter, she says. Fernandez says the push for   tuna holds a good lesson in this. In 1990, the U. S. banned tuna imports from Mexico because Mexican tuna fisheries didn’t meet American standards for protecting dolphins. The decision upset Mexico and it complained to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) the predecessor of the World Trade organization. A GATT panel concluded that the U. S. was wrong to embargo Mexico imports simply because it didn’t like the way the tuna was harvested. ”In that case, the U. S. was unfairly treating trade partners based on how . ..they harvested the product,” Fernandez says. What the U. S. could do without violating international trade agreements, was label tuna as either ” ” or not.  It gave seafood exporters an incentive to get a ” ” label, she says. Judging from this history, she says, the WTO will be fine with a labeling system (which the new rule doesn’t require) but it probably won’t be fine with an embargo, which could happen under the new rule. Cost is also a big concern in implementing the rule, according to Lekelia Jenkins, a marine conservation expert at Arizona State University and a former NOAA employee. Jenkins says her number one concern is how much money NOAA will have to enforce it. ”We can write laws as much as we want,” she says. ”It does not mean that there will be appropriations to fund those laws. Rob Williams, a marine conservation fellow at the Pew Charitable Trusts, says the amount of resources that the U. S. invests will determine the effectiveness of the new rule. Some resources, he says, should be used to help other countries implement U. S. conservation measures. He says it took the U. S. 40 years to refine these measures. ”We should be exporting those lessons learned so that other countries don’t have to take 40 years to learn,” he says. Otherwise, he says, ”countries presumably will just find other markets for their seafood.”"
"Citing local regulations, Apple has removed The New York Times news app from its app store in China. The incident is the latest in the long history of media restrictions in the country, but also in the ongoing pattern of tech companies getting involved in the efforts. The New York Times reports that Apple removed both its   and   apps from the app store in China on Dec. 23, though other prominent publications such as The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times as well as the Times’ crossword puzzle and   apps remain available. Along with other websites, the Times has faced restrictions for years. The site has been subject of blocks since 2012, when the newspaper reported on the wealth amassed by the family of the   minister. Apple did not explain Thursday what distinguished the Times from other outlets. Spokesman Fred Sainz shared a statement: ”For some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations. As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.” Sainz did not elaborate on what legal standard was applied to warrant the removal of the news app, but the Times suggested it was under 2016 regulations issued for mobile apps: ”The regulations say apps cannot ’engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others.’ The cyberspace administration says on its website that apps also cannot publish ’prohibited information.” Over the years, numerous publications have faced blackouts in China, including Bloomberg, Time and The Economist. Users in China sometimes use software to circumvent the government’s firewall to surf the Web and access blocked sites. For tech companies, China is a massive, lucrative market and a major manufacturing hub, but operations there are tricky. Sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google have been restricted. Apple’s own iBooks and iTunes Movies were blocked, as well, not long after they were introduced. For Apple, China is a key production location and sales market. But iPhone sales have slumped there in recent years. In May, Apple invested $1 billion in Chinese   app Didi Chuxing. The company has, in the past, removed other media apps from its App Store, but none as prominent as The Times, according to the newspaper. And it’s far from the first time that a tech company cooperated with the Chinese government to suppress content, as the industry generally complies with local regulations around the world. In 2016, The New York Times reported that Facebook quietly developed software that could prevent posts from appearing in people’s news feeds in specific parts of China, going further than the typical practice by U. S. Internet companies to block certain content after it’s posted. The newspaper also reported, just last month, on ”a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world’s biggest iPhone factory”  —   billions of dollars’ worth of incentives at the heart of Apple’s phone production. In 2014, the radio program Marketplace reported on LinkedIn censoring posts from its members that were deemed sensitive by China’s government. In 2010, Google altered how users in China could access the site as it faced possible loss of license to operate in the country. Perhaps the most notorious case dates back to early 2000s, when Chinese authorities arrested and imprisoned dissidents, including a Chinese journalist, based on evidence provided by Yahoo. Yahoo settled a lawsuit by the dissidents’ families in 2007. In 2005, Yahoo bought what later became its most valuable asset: a stake in a Chinese   site Alibaba."
"A comparison of kid brains and grownup brains may explain why our ability to recognize faces keeps getting better until about age 30. Brain scans of 25 adults and 22 children showed that an area devoted to facial recognition keeps growing long after adolescence, researchers report in the journal Science. The area didn’t acquire more neurons, says Jesse Gomez, a graduate student in neurosciences at Stanford University and the study’s lead author. Instead the brain region became more densely populated with the structures that connect and support neurons. ”You can imagine a   by   garden, and it has some number of flowers in there,” Gomez says. ”The number of flowers isn’t changing, but their stems and branches and leaves are getting more complex.” To see whether that sort of change occurred elsewhere in the brain, the researchers also looked at a nearby area that responds to places, instead of faces. In this area, there was no difference between children and adults. The results suggest that brain development is more varied than researchers once thought. For years, scientists have focused on a process known as synaptic pruning, which shapes the brain by eliminating unused connections among neurons. Most synaptic pruning takes place in the first few years of life. ”After age 3, the textbooks are pretty silent about what’s going on in the brain,” Gomez says. The continuing growth in facial recognition areas may be a response to the need to recognize more and more faces as children grow older, says Kalanit   a professor in the psychology department at Stanford. ”When you’re a young child, you need to recognize your family and a handful of friends,” she says. ”But by the time you’ve reached high school or college your social group has expanded to hundreds or even thousands of people.” And recognizing all those people requires a lot of brain power,   says, because ”all faces have the same features and the same configuration.” Ongoing changes in the brain may also help children focus on different sorts of faces at different stages of development, says Suzy Scherf, an assistant professor of psychology at Penn State University. ”Children’s face recognition early on is very much tuned to adult faces,” Scherf says. ”In adolescence it changes to be highly tuned toward adolescent faces.” Understanding how facial recognition develops throughout childhood could make it easier to figure out why some people have difficulty recognizing faces, researchers say. Gomez hopes to scan the brains of people with ”face blindness,” a disorder that can leave a person unable to recognize even familiar faces. And Scherf wants to know whether people with autism, who often struggle to recognize faces, have abnormal development in the facial recognition area of their brains."
"Director Damien Chazelle’s La La Land is an unapologetic musical that hearkens back to Hollywood’s glory days of song and dance. The passion and grandeur of the musical numbers might make you believe that Chazelle had always imagined himself working in the genre, but he tells Fresh Air’s Terry Gross that’s not the case. ”It wasn’t until I actually started making experimental films and, ironically, documentaries in college that I think my eyes got   or awakened, to . .. old classic Hollywood musicals,” Chazelle says. ”There was something about them that felt like, ’Oh my God, here is an experimental movie in mainstream packaging.’ ” La La Land is a love story set in the present day, but the influence of old Hollywood and musicals of the past is all around. The film features Emma Stone as an aspiring actress and Ryan Gosling as a jazz pianist, both of whom are struggling to reconcile their showbiz dreams with reality. Chazelle says that the film’s song and dance numbers provide the audience with an insight into the characters that is often missing in film. ”In a weird way, movies are kind of limited by what you see in front of the camera,” he says. ”Musicals find this wonderful way around that, because the songs are . .. an expression of inner feelings that can’t be articulated any other way.” On what musicals do that   can’t, There’s something so brash and defiant and almost   about the idea of just breaking the normal rules of normal reality. Movies have kind of been engineered over the century to somewhat reflect reality usually, even if it’s a fantasy or something. There’s some kind of an assumption that things are going to follow a certain order, and musicals just break that. They break it in the name of emotion. That, I think, was a really powerful, beautiful idea to me, that if you feel enough you break into song. On the film’s opening number, which is set in a freeway traffic jam  We’re on this kind of elevated freeway ramp that’s in utter gridlock and . .. one by one characters start to kind of join in this collective number. The idea was to go from [an] individual car radio . .. and all these individual sounds build in and sort of layer into this one collective song that eventually explodes into   joyful unison singing and dancing before all the drivers return to their cars. The idea was to sort of introduce the world and, I think even more importantly, begin the musical with as   a scene as we could possibly imagine  —   really try to announce our intentions right off the bat with a bang. One thing that I think that has kind of been lost a little bit is the idea of choreographing dance for the camera. That to me was the beautiful thing about old Hollywood musicals from Fred [Astaire] and Ginger [Rogers] through the Gene   Donen pictures, to something like Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. . .. There’s a wonderful barn dance set piece in the middle of that movie, which was a big reference for this. . .. It’s all about how the dance looks in relation to a single camera, not ”let’s do the dance like a live event and just film it with 15 cameras and then we’ll find it in the editing room.” So that long take aesthetic was there right from the beginning. And my choreographer, Mandy Moore, had to choreograph with that in mind, and the DP [director of photography] Linus Sandgren, had to kind of be involved in that choreography. So it was really the three of us and this troupe of dancers that Mandy and I brought together rehearsing, rehearsing, rehearsing for months. And often very theoretically, because the other problem with shooting on a freeway ramp is that you can’t really rehearse onsite very easily. And so we were able to find this elevated ramp that the city would let us shut down for a Saturday and a Sunday to shoot. On wanting to appeal to musical skeptics, You hear a lot, especially when you’re making a musical today, how much distaste for musicals exists in the world and how many skeptics there are, so . .. it was important to me to reach out to the skeptics, to have this movie not just play for a little coterie of musical   of which I would include myself. . .. There is that kind of needle scratch sometimes  —   you can even feel it in a theater when a song begins and it hasn’t been quite properly set up. So I always thought of the analogy of the frog in boiling water and the idea that if you drop the frog right away in boiling water it feels it and jumps out, but if you put a frog in room temperature water and then slowly boil it over the course of however long, it won’t realize that it’s boiling and it’ll just sit there and die. So I kind of wanted to put the audience through  —   this will sound morbid  —   but through the same sort of process where they kind of don’t even necessarily realize as it’s happening that they’re being sucked into a musical. On making Whiplash (a film about a musician who attends a   music conservatory) based on his own experience as a jazz drummer  At the point that I wrote Whiplash I had been paying the bills in L. A. mainly by writing genre pictures and sort of doing rewrites on horror movies and sequels and stuff that was very not personal to me. I was just trying to make a living. . .. Whiplash in some ways was the most autobiographical thing that I had written up to that point. . .. There was a phase in my life, it was mainly high school into college, where music and specifically jazz drumming, as you see in Whiplash, was everything for me. It had a lot to do with a very intensive jazz program at my high school that I was a part of, and a very demanding teacher, and certain emotions I felt as a young player where the kind of enjoyment and appreciation of the art of music was inextricably wrapped up in fear and dread and anxiety about getting something wrong. . .. I sort of thought . .. maybe I could kind of write those experiences as though it were a genre film, as though it were a thriller or a kind of war movie or a sports film, something where you expect to see a lot of physical violence and try to sublimate that violence into emotional violence, into the music and into the style. On what Whiplash and La La Land have in common, When I think about when I was writing Whiplash, a lot of what I was grappling with as well is how do you become whatever you’re supposed to become? I guess that’s there in La La Land, too. . .. You don’t know for sure whether you actually ”have what it takes,” and also you don’t know if that whole idea of having what it takes  —   is that actually its own kind of nonsense? Is talent even really a thing? Is it actually just the best musicians are the musicians that work the hardest? Or the musicians who listened the most? Or the musicians who are lucky enough to be at a certain place at a certain time and what we think of as a meritocracy is actually not? . .. I think all those questions were swirling around my head and are still, I think, to a certain extent."
"After multiple recent studies showing that feeding   foods to infants can reduce the risk of peanut allergies, there are new federal guidelines for parents about when to start feeding their infants such foods. The National Institutes of Health announced Thursday that a panel of allergy experts recommends that parents introduce   foods into the diets of babies as young as 4 to 6 months. As the NIH summary for parents and caregivers states, introducing babies with severe eczema or egg allergy  —   conditions that increase the risk of peanut allergy  —   to foods containing peanuts at that age can reduce the risk of developing peanut allergy. However, the guidelines spell out that these infants should be evaluated by an allergy specialist before their parents or caregivers introduce them to peanuts. For infants without the risk factors of eczema or known food allergies, parents can stick to whatever   diet they prefer. As NPR’s Allison Aubrey reports, ”parents of infants used to be told to hold off on introducing   foods, sometimes until the toddler years, especially if there was a family history of allergies.” Experts thought this could reduce the chances of developing an allergy. But over the past few years, Allison says, several large studies such as this one and this one ”have found that babies at high risk for becoming allergic to peanuts are less likely to develop the allergy if they are regularly fed   foods in the first year of life.” As NPR’s Patti Neighmond has reported: ”The guidelines are largely based on dramatic findings from a large study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2015. Researchers found that babies at high risk of developing a peanut allergy who were fed the equivalent of about 4 heaping teaspoons of peanut butter each week, starting at the age of 4 to 11 months, were about 80 percent less likely to develop an allergy to the legume by age 5 than similar kids who avoided peanuts. The benefit held up even after the children stopped getting the puree, a   study found. ”Allergic reactions to peanuts can range from hives or rashes to, in the most extreme cases, trouble breathing and even death.” The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has published the full text of the guidelines for the prevention of peanut allergies, as well as summaries for doctors and parents, on its website. Infants and small children should never be given whole peanuts due to the risk of choking, the NIH cautions. A video aimed at parents warns that even undiluted peanut butter can be dangerous for infants because it is thick and sticky. The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology video, which features Northwestern University pediatrician Ruchi S. Gupta, recommends adding hot water to 2 teaspoons of peanut butter to make a warm puree. Feed a little bit of the puree to the child, and then monitor for about 10 minutes to make sure there is no reaction such as hives, rash or trouble breathing before continuing to feed the child   foods."
"As President Obama’s tenure in the White House draws to a close, he’s looking back on eight years of work  —   and ahead toward what he sees as a brighter future for the U. S. In a letter to the American public, Obama says he’s proud that the country is ”stronger and more prosperous” than it was eight years ago  —   and hopeful that the country will build on the progress he sees. The letter is paired with a set of ”Cabinet Exit Memos”  —   Cabinet members wrote about the work their teams have done, and the work they see that remains for the next administration. The secretary of the interior says new parks and public lands tell a more inclusive story of America the secretary of agriculture highlights a drop in rural unemployment the secretary of Veterans Affairs points out, as an aside, that the VA is still providing benefits to the child of a Union soldier  —   from the Civil War. Obama, for his part, begins with a summary of the woes the U. S. faced at the beginning of 2009, in the midst of a financial crisis and two wars. He describes economic growth, an increase in health insurance coverage, a boost in renewable energy production and troop drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan, among other things. He describes the state of the country today as ”a situation I’m proud to leave to my successor,” whom he never names. ”And it’s thanks to you,” Obama writes to the American people, ”to the hard work you’ve put in the sacrifices you’ve made for your families and communities the way you’ve looked out for one another.” He says that ”change is never easy, and never quick,” and that he wishes he’d been able to enact gun safety measures and immigration reform. ”We still have more work to do for every American still in need of a good job or a raise, paid leave or a dignified retirement,” he said. ”What won’t help is taking health care away from 30 million Americans, most of them white and working class denying overtime pay to workers, most of whom have more than earned it or privatizing Medicare and Social Security and letting Wall Street regulate itself again  —   none of which   Americans voted for.” Obama concluded: ”We will have to move forward as we always have  —   together. As a people who believe that out of many, we are one that we are bound not by any one race or religion, but rather an adherence to a common creed that all of us are created equal in the eyes of God. And I’m confident we will. Because the change we’ve brought about these past eight years was never about me. It was about you. It is you, the American people, who have made the progress of the last eight years possible. It is you who will make our future progress possible. That, after all, is the story of America  —   a story of progress. However halting, however incomplete, however harshly challenged at each point on our journey  —   the story of America is a story of progress. . .. ”It has been the privilege of my life to serve as your President. And as I prepare to pass the baton and do my part as a private citizen, I’m proud to say that we have laid a new foundation for America. A new future is ours to write. And I’m as confident as ever that it will be led by the United States of America  —   and that our best days are still ahead.” Obama is expected to deliver a farewell address on Tuesday in Chicago."
"On a cold night in January nine years ago, Barack Obama won the Iowa caucuses. That first big step on the young senator’s unlikely path to the White House was fueled by an army of campaign volunteers, which Obama later called one of his proudest legacies. ”That’s what America needs right now,” Obama told campaign workers a year later, after he was sworn in as president. ”Active citizens like you, who are willing to turn towards each other, talk to people you’ve never met, and say, ’C’mon, let’s go do this. Let’s go change the world.’ ” There was nothing glamorous about the work those volunteers did for Obama: A lot of knocking on doors and making phone calls. But for many veterans of that first Obama campaign, it’s a time they’ll never forget. ”I’ll be friends with some of those people forever,” says Nathan Blake, who quit his job at a Des Moines law firm to work for the upstart campaign. ”We’ve got that shared experience that was   and historic and important, and good for our country.” It wasn’t obvious at the time that the man they were knocking on doors for eventually would make his way to the White House, but even in those early days, Blake was a ”true believer.” He had plenty of company. Brian Kirschling, who works at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Iowa City, was older than a lot of Obama campaign volunteers, and he’d never been politically active. But by 2007, Kirschling had decided it was time to roll up his sleeves  —   a decision he explains by quoting Dr. Seuss. ”His quote from The Lorax is, ’Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, noting is going to get better. It’s not,’” Kirschling says. Kirschling became a ”precinct captain” for Obama. Children’s books and a Disney video were key parts of his caucus night toolkit for attracting parents with young children. ”In the Iowa caucus,” he says, ”it’s about how many people are standing in your corner. I can tell you everybody in that room that had kids was in our corner.” Aletheia Henry was just out of graduate school in 2007 when she heard a story on the radio about a training camp Obama was running for campaign volunteers. She packed her car and drove from Ohio to Chicago, listening to a tape of Obama’s book, The Audacity of Hope, along the way. ”By the time I got there I was really hooked,” Henry says. She wound up working as a field organizer for Obama in eight different states. ”I would show up in a city and not know anyone,” Henry recalls. But she’d be given the name of someone who’d volunteered to let her sleep on their couch. ”And they’d have me over and have dinner and talk a little and they’d let me stay there for weeks or months at a time and we’d work together on this democracy.” After Obama was elected, campaign workers went their separate ways. Nathan Blake spent time in Washington, working for the Agriculture Department. He’s now back in Iowa, doing consumer protection work for the attorney general. Brian Kirschling, who’d never done much before in politics, decided to run for his local school board. And in a crowded field of nine candidates he made a point of knocking on doors all over the city. ”Which is exactly what I remembered learning with the Obama campaign,” Kirschling says. ”It was uncomfortable at times to go into parts of the district that don’t necessarily agree with my opinion. But it allowed me the opportunity to stand on doorsteps or sometimes come into their house and have those conversations.” Aletheia Henry went on to run Obama’s successful reelection campaign in Pennsylvania. In 2016, she was an adviser to Hillary Clinton’s campaign there, which was not so successful. ”I think these next few years are going to take a lot of conversation,” Henry says, recalling the motto of Obama’s 2008 campaign: ”Respect, Empower, Include.” ”I come from rural Ohio,” she says. ”I understand some of the frustrations that Trump supporters are feeling. We should talk with everybody about how we can work together to make our country a little bit better.” Many of those who worked to elect Obama years ago are disappointed with the man who will follow him to the White House. But they’re not giving up on the political process. Brian Kirschling says while it’s easy to be apathetic, the lesson he learned from the Obama campaign is that if you want to effect change, you have to be a part of it. ”I think it’s pretty cool that a guy who was a community organizer ended up energizing and empowering people across the country to get involved and do things that they might not have done before,” he says. Kirschling suspects he’s one of many people who were moved by Obama to try something different. Nathan Blake agrees. His social media feed is full of colleagues from the 2008 campaign who are still carrying on their mission  —   in politics, business, or   just as Obama predicted. ”It’s not surprising that that was inspiring to a lot of us and that we responded in a way that said, ’Yeah, this is something I want to do with my life.’ Figure out different ways, wherever I am, however I can do it, to continue being involved and live out this Obama legacy.” More than a library or foundation, Blake says, that’s this president’s lasting impact: an army of campaign veterans who continue to serve."
"Updated at 4:15 p. m. ET, Four people have been charged with hate crimes for allegedly carrying out an assault,   online, in which a man was tied up, hit and cut with a knife by several assailants. Authorities say the victim, who had been reported missing before the attack, has ”mental health challenges.” He was encountered by police on Tuesday evening and is recovering in the hospital. ”There was never a question whether or not this incident qualified to be investigated as a hate crime,” Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a news conference Thursday afternoon, citing the victim’s mental capacity, race and other factors. ”The actions in that video are reprehensible.” The Facebook Live stream showing the attack has been deleted. But multiple outlets have posted videos they identify as archives of the stream, recorded by a woman who frequently turns the camera on herself. The clips show multiple people taunting, threatening and hitting a man who is tied up in a corner. At least once, a man uses a knife to cut the victim’s hair, cutting into his scalp. On the video, the assailants, who are black, say ”F*** Donald Trump” and ”F*** white people.” They force the victim, who is white, to say ”F*** Donald Trump,” as well. The four people accused of the crime have each been charged with a hate crime, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint, and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, according to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office. Other charges include burglary, robbery and possession of a stolen motor vehicle. As for the remarks about   Donald Trump, police Cmdr. Kevin Duffin said at a news conference late Wednesday that investigators are working to determine whether the statements are ”sincere or just stupid ranting and raving.” Chicago police found the victim in distress on the street before they were aware of the existence of the Facebook live stream, authorities said at the news conference. The four suspects were arrested after police were called to a residence near where they’d found the man and then connected the incident and the location. The victim, a resident of a Chicago suburb, apparently spent at least 24 hours in the company of his alleged assailants  —   one of whom he knew from school, police say. He had been reported missing on Monday. Police say he traveled into the city with his acquaintance in a stolen van. A GoFundMe account for the victim has been set up a public relations representative for GoFundMe says the website will be working with the campaign organizer to ensure all money raised reaches the victim. At Wednesday’s news conference, Johnson highlighted the ”brazenness” of the assailants, for not just carrying out the attack but broadcasting it ”for all to see.” ”It’s sickening,” he said. ”It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat somebody like that. I’ve been a cop for 28 years  —   I’ve seen things that you shouldn’t see in a lifetime  —   but it still amazes me how you still see things that you just shouldn’t [see].”"
"Fans are so geeked about Showtime’s coming revival of Twin Peaks that they turned a   promotional video into a viral hit.   David Lynch appears in a black suit and tie (seemingly reprising his role as FBI Regional Bureau Chief Gordon Cole) wordlessly consuming a glazed doughnut while the show’s distinctive, mournful theme plays in the background. The video has drawn more than 500, 000 views. That blend of mystery and weirdness helped make Twin Peaks a hit back in 1990, and it’s made Showtime’s revival one of the most anticipated new TV shows of 2017  —   mostly because fans have no idea what the guy who made Eraserhead and Blue Velvet might do with the resources and creative freedom offered by a premium cable channel. Lynch was already an   director known for surreal, sometimes violent films when he and   Mark Frost developed Twin Peaks. (Frost was a writer on NBC’s pioneering cop drama Hill Street Blues, and had worked with Lynch on a movie about Marilyn Monroe that was never made.) Together, they cooked up a story about the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer in the fictional town of Twin Peaks, Wash. The FBI agent sent to investigate the case was Kyle MacLachlan’s Dale Cooper, a clean cut guy with an odd enthusiasm for trees, cherry pie and good coffee. Cooper constantly recorded detailed notes on just about everything for an unseen assistant named Diane. What followed was a series that redefined the boundaries of television. It mashed up genres, moving from a   murder mystery to a surreal, dreamlike supernatural story. It revealed the seedy, sometimes absurd underbelly of a placid, rural town long before Fargo would take that story to another level. And it sparked legions of fans obsessed with the show’s weird details, like the Log Lady, a woman who seemed to communicate with supernatural forces through a log she carried around. And now Lynch and Frost want to try it again. Showtime’s revival features MacLachlan and much of the series’ original cast, including Sherilyn Fenn, Ray Wise and David Duchovny. And yes, the Log Lady, aka Catherine E. Coulson, also appears on the cast list, though the actress died late last year. They’re joined by new names like Michael Cera, Amanda Seyfried, Trent Reznor and Naomi Watts. Lara Flynn Boyle, who played Laura Palmer’s best friend in the original series, isn’t on Showtime’s new cast list and neither is Heather Graham, who played Cooper’s love interest. In a press release, Showtime says Lynch will direct every episode of the new Twin Peaks, which picks up 25 years after Palmer was killed. One clue about the revival’s plot may come from Mark Frost’s new novel, The Secret History of Twin Peaks. The book depicts documents contained in a dossier with loads of information connected to Cooper’s investigation. Readers leafing through the pages see FBI memos, old photographs, newspaper clippings, fictional lost letters from legendary explorers Lewis and Clark, and much more, annotated with observations by a new agent attempting to determine who compiled all this stuff. Like Twin Peaks itself, the book creates an oddball world fans are encouraged to immerse themselves in. The mystery is mostly an excuse the savor the strange environment and its exquisitely crafted details. A look back at the old series (Amazon offers the program via streaming to Prime members and Showtime gave subscribers access on Dec. 26) reveals a lot that doesn’t hold up well. Twin Peaks is very clearly the bridge between the more workmanlike television shows of the 1970s and ’80s and the more filmic small screen work done today. Its nods to soap opera sometimes led to clunky scenes with awkward acting, and the show’s look wasn’t always as grand as its ambitions. Still, Twin Peaks is filled with iconic moments that continue to resonate with fans today, and it influenced shows as different as AMC’s The Killing and AE’s Bates Motel. The question now is: How will Lynch and Frost surprise fans with a new story at a time when so much of today’s high quality television already feels like a distant homage to Twin Peaks?"
"Dorlyn Catron’s cane is making its radio debut today  —   its name is Pete. (”He’s important to my life. He ought to have a name,” she says.) Catron is participating in one of the America InSight tours at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D. C. The museum offers    tours, led by specially trained docents, to blind and visually impaired visitors. Docent Betsy Hennigan stops the group of nine visitors in front of Girl Skating, a small bronze sculpture from 1907 by Abastenia St. Leger Eberle. The   girl is full of joy. The visitors  —   of varied ages, races and backgrounds  —   stand close together, hands on top of their long canes, facing Hennigan as she describes the artwork: The little girl careens forward, arms outstretched, her hair and her dress flow behind her. Carol Wilson trains the 12 volunteer docents. ”Sight isn’t the only pathway to understand art,” she says. Wilson suggests the docents invite visitors to imitate the pose of a sculpture and use other senses in their verbal descriptions. ”There’s a red in one of the paintings and I’ve said it’s like biting into a strawberry,” says docent Phoebe Kline. William Johnson’s painting Café depicts a man and a woman sitting    having a drink in a jazz cafe. ”There’s no way you can see music in this piece,” says Hennigan, ”but I ask them to imagine hearing jazz. . .. Can you smell cigarettes? Can you smell the alcohol?” Docent Edmund Bonder uses real music to help bring to life a painting of a young woman at a piano. He describes her fingers on the upper right part of the keyboard, and then plays some classical piano music on his smartphone right in the middle of the gallery. No one shushes him. ”I check with security personnel beforehand and let them know this is what’s going to happen,” Bonder says with a laugh. Sometimes   and blind visitors can actually touch the art  —   in   gloves. Kline learned something herself, when a   felt Hugo Robus’ sculpture Water Carrier. ”She ran her hands down the body of this female figure, and her first remark was: Oh, she’s pregnant,” Kline recalls. ”And I had never thought about that. But in fact, the figure does look like a pregnant woman. Here was a kid really showing me something that I had been looking at for 35 years, probably, and had never noticed.” The visitors move slowly through the museum, some ”seeing” in their imaginations, others, with low vision, getting really close to the artwork to see it better with magnifying devices. The docents take questions about the art and the artists. Visitor Kilof Legge listens intently. He’s taken lots of these tours. He has had macular degeneration since childhood and has deeply missed art. ”For the longest time I really felt angry when I came into a museum,” he says. ”And hurt and insulted, almost. Because these are public places and I felt I was denied access.” He says he is ”grateful and excited” to have the art world opened back up to him through tours like these. This was visitor Cheryl Young’s second American InSight tour. She was born sighted, so she has color memory. ”This experience . .. brought back another piece of my life that I haven’t been able to explore since my vision loss,” she says. Twice a month, the Smithsonian’s American Art Museum helps blind and   visitors to see art in their minds’ eyes  —   and demonstrate that there are many ways to experience a work of art."
"It’s Monday, 8 a. m. and these teens have already mucked stalls in the barn and fed the goats, alpacas and miniature cows. They’ve rounded up eggs in the henhouse, harvested cabbages and a few   tomatoes, and arranged them in tidy tiers to sell in the Agriculture Store. Now they’re ready to put in a full day of classes. These are the Aggies. They’re the first kids to arrive at John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens, in the morning, and the last to leave on the New York City buses and subways that shuttle them home in the evening. Some 600 of the city’s public school students are enrolled in Bowne’s specialized,   agriculture program. Like most of their schoolmates, the Aggies follow an ordinary curriculum of English, math and social studies. But they also learn the building blocks of diverse careers in the booming industry of agriculture, which sees almost 60, 000 new jobs open up in the U. S. every year, according to the USDA. The Aggies grow crops, care for livestock and learn the rudiments of floriculture, viticulture, aquaculture, biotechnology and entrepreneurship. While high schools in rural farming areas have long prepared students for these sorts of jobs, they can’t come close to meeting the demand. So some urban public high schools are stepping in to fill the void. Since 2007, students at the Food and Finance High School in midtown Manhattan have grown tilapia and lettuces in interconnected,   labs built by a Cornell University agriculturist. The city’s Harbor School on Governors Island has so far graduated three classes of aquaculture students, who have hatched trout and worked on oyster farms that supply restaurants. Bowne’s program is much older  —   it harks back to World War I, when city boys were recruited to fill in for upstate farmers serving overseas. Today, it attracts a diverse array of students, including many girls. Many are low income some have parents who hail from Central America and the Caribbean, where more than a few once grew their own subsistence crops. ”We’re trying to give these kids as many career opportunities as possible,” says Steve Perry, who has headed Bowne’s program for 20 years, and also graduated from it. ”But for a lot of them, we’re also home base.” Forty percent of Aggies go on to   programs at colleges like SUNY Cobleskill and Cornell, studying everything from animal sciences to food safety and farm management. ”It’s so annoying that everyone thinks we’re just farmers,” says Aggie senior Erika Jerez with a roll of her eyes. She’s sporting a sweatshirt from Rutgers University, where she hopes to study food processing next fall. ”But there’s so much more to ag than farming.” Fellow Aggie senior Jailene Cajilina says her parents farmed a piece of land back in Ecuador. Despite that, she admits that before starting at Bowne, she had a poor idea of how food was grown. ”Being in a city, you lose touch that someone out there is breaking their back growing these plants, having to slug it out with animals and the weather,” she says. Cajilina spent four years doing everything from weeding broccoli beds to interning at an upstate organic dairy, gaining firsthand knowledge of the physical and financial struggles of farmers. That’s not a life she’s eager to replicate. Instead, she plans to become a   veterinarian. ”A lot of these kids are focused on supporting their families,” explains Rebecca Cossa, a Bowne plant science teacher. And with so many farms starting up within city limits, she sees potential for future generations of Aggies to find   careers close to home. There’s also demand for ag teachers. The New York State Education Department got requests to help set up 65   programs statewide last year, some of which require certified ag teachers. It’s a number administrators expect to keep growing over the next decade. Natalie Arroyo already knows that education is the direction she’ll be heading when she graduates from Bowne this June. After an internship last summer in which she taught children about animals at a Fresh Air Fund camp, she says, ”To see someone who wants to learn what you know, and choose their career based on something you taught them, that’s really inspiring.” Says Mayorga, ”The kids in the STEM program at Bowne know about science and technology.” But the Aggies, she says, can grow their own food. ”That’s right,” says fellow Aggie Dayana Panora. ”The Aggies are ready for the zombie apocalypse!” Lela Nargi is a   journalist and cookbook author. Her writing has appeared in publications including Gastronomica, Civil Eats and Roads  Kingdoms."
"The Shins are back with the group’s first new album since 2012’s Port Of Morrow. Heartworms is set to drop on March 10 on Aural   Records. In making the announcement today, the band shared the joyfully infectious pop cut ”Name For You” and a lyric video. Frontman James Mercer produced Heartworms on his own, a first since The Shins’ 2001 debut album, Oh, Inverted World. He says the new music was inspired, in part, by growing older and parenthood. ”Name For You” is a hopeful ode of empowerment to Mercer’s daughters. ”Given all the drops in the ocean, better take it one sip at a time,” Mercer sings. ”Somebody with an antique notion comes along to tighten the line, they’re just afraid of you speaking your mind.” This is the second song the band has shared from Heartworms. In October, The Shins released a   video for the song ”Dead Alive.” Full track listing for Heartworms:"
"Note: NPR’s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify or Apple Music playlist at the bottom of the page. Natalie Hemby’s debut album starts out very country, risking corniness from the  . Southern gospel harmonies float over a   beat as Hemby, one of Nashville’s premier songwriters, sings of   traditions  —   picket fences, alma maters, ”the roots of my inheritance.” She’s waxing poetic about Puxico, Missouri, population 881, where the Nashville native spent summers fishing with her grandpa and attending its annual Homecoming festival. In 2011, Hemby began work on a documentary about Puxico that lovingly captures the town’s deep communal roots within an American moment when the rural is both overlooked and stigmatized. Celebrating small towns is a country staple. But Puxico the album, like the documentary in which its songs first appeared, doesn’t settle into clichés. Instead, Hemby and her producer (and husband) Mike Wrucke explore both the   missions of memory and its tendency to slip into fiction: its comforting haziness coming into focus when we need it as a balm for longing or a way of coping with the new. The songs on Puxico both enact and examine memory. Some place the listener in the middle of a flashback: ”Lovers On Display” captures the thrill of young love declaring itself ”Worn” considers the material things that represent   love ”Ferris Wheel” savors an annual ritual that becomes a metaphor for embracing change. In the subtly dynamic ”I’ll Remember How You Loved Me,” Hemby muses upon the specifics that slip from her mental grasp and the affinities that remain deep in her neural net. ”The feeling hangs around in the wall of your mind, like a secret that I keep in a box under the bed,” she observes. Our recollections are shadow forces that we treasure and sometimes hide. As important as Hemby’s insightful, evocative lyrics  —   the songs were   with several of her Nashville   friends, notably Trent Dabbs  —   is the sound of Puxico, which defies country classification in ways similar to the artists for whom Hemby often writes hits, like Miranda Lambert and Little Big Town. Wrucke, who’s produced albums for Nashville auteurs including Lambert and David Nail, places Hemby’s delicate voice  —   the calm intonation of a trusted friend  —   within airy arrangements whose sonic reference points are both subtle and varied. Greg Leisz, a national treasure on pedal steel, threads his instrument through these tracks like the voice of Hemby’s subconscious. Alison Krauss is an obvious touchstone for Hemby and Wrucke, but they also stretch toward   sources like Sheryl Crow or the U2 of No Line On The Horizon. Plenty of musical country keepsakes are displayed here, too, from the fingerpicking in ”Cairo, IL” to the nod in ”Grand Restoration” to ”Will The Circle Be Unbroken.” Hemby wants to celebrate those circles that make up most of our lives, away from our family legacies and back toward them. Puxico is a labor of love that’s also a deeply insightful compendium of the stories we tell ourselves in order to preserve it."
"Ford Motor Co. ’s decision this week to cancel construction of an auto plant in Mexico has shocked that country, causing the peso to slump and stirring up outrage toward   Donald Trump. Anger is high toward the incoming U. S. president in the state where the Ford plant was under construction  —   and was slated to employ nearly 3, 000 local workers. Usually the dusty construction site of the   Mexican Ford auto plant is full of activity. Now only one large tractor can be seen grading roads at the   site, located outside the small town of Villa de Reyes in the central Mexican state of San Luis Potosi. Guards at the site’s entrance say the mood is very tense and that the situation is deeply discouraging. ”We all thought this was a   project,” says Juan Gonzalez, who had hoped to stay on when the Ford plant opened in three years. Gustavo Puente Orozco, San Luis Potosi’s secretary of economic development, says the news, while not totally unexpected, came as a shock. Donald Trump began putting a lot of pressure on Ford to pull out of Mexico during the campaign, but Puente says Ford officials in Mexico kept assuring him the project was moving forward, and he says construction kept going. Ford says market forces prompted it to cancel the Mexico plant  —   small cars, like the Ford Focus that was to be built there, just haven’t been selling well, especially with low gas prices. The scrapped project adds to a rough start to 2017 for Mexicans. Gas prices in the country spiked by as much as 20 percent in some parts of the country on Jan. 1, when the government lifted   subsidies. The peso dropped nearly a full percentage point on the Ford news, and there are fears that inflation is going to rise above 4 percent this year. Protests have broken out every day since the gas prices spiked, with demonstrators blocking major highways and thoroughfares in states throughout the country. Near the scuttled Ford plant in the nearby town of Villa De Reyes, residents are directing most of their anger about Mexico’s woes at the American  . As music blares from a food stall in the town’s small outdoor market, housewife Maria de Jesus Ramirez Martinez gets visibly angry when asked about the Ford plant closure. ”Trump is blaming us Mexicans for everything . .. and it’s not right . .. it’s just not right,” she says. Ramirez says the town was counting on those jobs and that without them, more Mexicans will head north to the United States to find work. San Luis Potosi has been a bright spot in Mexico’s otherwise sluggish economy with so many international companies here, unemployment is officially below 3 percent, and the region has been growing at twice the pace of the country as a whole. On Villa de Reyes’ small town plaza, Salvador Guerra, now retired, says he doesn’t want to see the state’s gains be undermined by Trump, who’s not even president yet. ”Imagine what he’s going to do to us once he takes power,” says Guerra. And Guerra says he’s just as mad at Mexico’s leaders, who he says haven’t done enough to stand up to Trump. On Wednesday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto announced a shakeup in his Cabinet, appointing a former finance adviser as the new foreign minister, who Pena Nieto says will push for a more constructive relationship. ”It should be a relationship that allows us to strengthen bilateral ties,” says Pena Nieto. And, he adds, one that doesn’t undermine the sovereignty or the dignity of Mexicans."
"When Donald Trump takes to Twitter, some companies shudder. This week, Ford Motor Co. said it would scrap a $1. 6 billion plant in Mexico in favor of expanding an existing one in Michigan. That happened on the same day the   tweeted criticism of General Motors for manufacturing its Chevy Cruze vehicles in Mexico. GM says only a small number of the cars produced in Mexico are sold in the U. S. but that’s a detail that may not register with the public. Economist Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution says of companies that produce consumer goods: ”They can’t afford bad publicity.” Bosworth notes that so far Trump’s targets are companies that are expanding or planning to build operations in Mexico. He has not singled out U. S. companies that built plants there long ago. ”He focuses in on these individual cases,” says Bosworth, ”but there doesn’t seem to be a rule.” In November, under pressure from Trump, heating and cooling firm Carrier Corp. a subsidiary of United Technologies, said it would keep hundreds of jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to a plant in Mexico. Who might be next? Bosworth says the Trump Twitter spotlight is shining the most on big companies with   household brands. Automakers are especially at risk because of the sector’s high volume of   trade, and because it is so vulnerable to consumer opinion. Bosworth says going after a maker of obscure chemicals or a small firm that makes car components doesn’t produce great headlines, nor does it move public sentiment. Trump’s focus is on finished products. ”If they’re not assembled, they can’t be identified in the terms of a specific model of a General Motors car,” Bosworth says. ”It doesn’t have the same public appeal.” Trump has talked tough on China trade as well, but Bosworth notes he has not gone after individual companies  —   Apple, for example, and its huge iPhone assembly operations there. China’s economy is almost as big as the U. S.’s, and it has the power to inflict lots of pain on U. S. companies, like Boeing  —   so interfering there could backfire for American workers. Bosworth says picking on Mexico is like fighting the weak kid on the playground: It’s less likely to elicit a retaliatory response. U. S. companies are the biggest foreign investors in Mexico, and U. S.  trade is worth about half a trillion dollars annually. ”It’s a much weaker economy,” Bosworth notes, ”much fewer options available to them.” Economist Derek Scissors at the American Enterprise Institute says retailers, banks and other service providers aren’t likely to be targeted. And, he says, he hopes the singling out of individual companies will stop once Trump takes office. ”When you’re president, you shouldn’t be bothering one company. You should be changing policies such as corporate taxes, to change the whole landscape,” Scissors argues. ”Getting down into the details can’t be done by Twitter.” He acknowledges that tweeting about trade does accomplish a few things. First, it appeals to Trump’s base. ”Probably the reason that he won the election is the effort to   manufacturing,” he says, ”not to accept it as inevitable that manufacturing will head overseas.” The tweets also telegraph a message, he says, not just to the specific companies Trump has targeted, but also to firms in other industries which might be thinking about expanding elsewhere besides Mexico. ”It’s not going to stop at very   manufacturers that consumers know about,” Scissors says. ”It will continue. He’s just sending the signal now to everyone, ’This is your chance to make an adjustment.’ ”"
"Wyoming has become a flash point in the debate over whether hundreds of millions of acres of federal public lands should be turned over to state hands. From Buzz Hettick’s place on the edge of the windswept college town of Laramie, it’s a short drive into the heart of these remote lands, vast tracts run by the federal Bureau of Land Management. On a recent, blustery morning, Hettick was scouting out an elk hunt in the Laramie range, a patchwork of private and public BLM land north of his home. ”A lot of wildlife uses public lands,” he says. So do big game hunters like Hettick. Hunting is big business in the rural West and Wyoming is no exception. A recent study estimated it brings in roughly $25 million into Albany County’s economy alone. Hettick is eager to show off this land  —   and talk about protecting access to it  —   to anyone who will make the trip. ”I just don’t see how people can look at this out here . .. and all they see is a dollar sign attached to it there’s a lot more than that,” Hettick says. When it comes to politics, those dollar signs and federal lands are inextricably linked in the West. There’s always pressure to lease more land to private producers of oil, gas, coal and, lately, wind. But avid sportsmen like Hettick, who lobbies for the national group Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, now see a new threat. ”Anytime there’s even a whisper of anybody that wants to transfer federal lands to the states, you’re going to raise the ire and the hackles of the outdoor community . .. in particular hunters and fisherman,” Hettick says. This time it’s more than just a whisper. At their party’s 2016 convention in Cleveland last summer, Republicans included a provision in the RNC platform calling for the transfer of ownership of federal land to states. One of the biggest questions surrounding this is whether a rural state like Wyoming with a small budget can really afford to manage all this land. Groups like BHA worry the   states would be forced to sell it, which could endanger access to hunters or anyone else who likes to enjoy U. S. public lands. It’s not yet clear whether   Donald Trump endorses the idea. But his son, Donald Trump Jr. is an avid hunter and member of Hettick’s group. The younger Trump is said to have been influential in his father’s pick of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, who opposes the transfer, to be interior secretary. Nevertheless, Hettick isn’t hedging any bets. He says sportsmen are on offense. ”It’s the biggest battle that sportsmen are going to have to face in my lifetime,” he says. In Wyoming, that battle is starting in the legislature. Lawmakers are considering a proposed constitutional amendment that would lay the groundwork for Wyoming to own and manage federal public land by 2019, should the   Congress move ahead with the transfer. Hettick mobilized sportsmen from around the state to brave snowy roads and travel to the capital, Cheyenne, for a recent hearing. Clad in camouflage, they wore ”keep public lands public” stickers and lined up to testify against the proposed amendment. Cheers and woops erupted when one hunter at the hearing advised the committee that they didn’t support any of the bill’s language, ”because we don’t support the amendment.” Neither does Wyoming’s Republican Governor Matt Mead. In an interview with the Casper   recently, Mead questioned the legality of transferring federal lands in the first place. He also wondered how his state would pay for things like battling wildfires, a bill that’s usually picked up by the federal government. State Sen. Larry Hicks, who’s pushing the amendment, says he’s done the math. He says an   state like Wyoming can afford to take over the land because of the increased tax revenues the state will be able to reap from it. ”We run about a $3 billion budget and we’re sending a billion dollars of federal minerals back to Washington, D. C.,” Hicks says. ”That’s a 25 percent increase in our state revenues right off the bat.” His math may not take into account the booms and busts of natural resource prices. But for Hicks, this is about a lot more than economics. It’s a cultural battle. He says rural communities that depend on mining, logging and drilling on federal lands are suffering. ”A lot of people just feel like they have no more voice,” he says. People are moving out and schools are shutting down. Hicks says the federal government is too restrictive. ”It’s detrimental,” he says. ”There are multiple generations of families and they feel like that their heritage and their lifestyle has been stolen from them.” Republican or Democrat, bashing the federal government is popular political sport in Wyoming. And like any relationship, Wyoming’s relationship with Washington, D. C. is complicated. In quite a few small towns here, the federal government is the largest employer. And the state depends heavily on federal dollars for everything from highways to health care to education. A report commissioned by the legislature’s own committee considering the constitutional amendment noted that if the transfer goes forward, the state would automatically lose close to $30 million in federal dollars earmarked for infrastructure in counties that have large amounts of   federal public land. ”I see very little evidence that there’s a groundswell of support for it in the state of Wyoming,” says Greg Cawley, a political science professor at the University of Wyoming. Cawley has studied   government movements in the West, dating back to the Sagebrush Rebellion in the 1970s. ”Every time the federal government does something that irritates Western ranchers, miners, what have you, this issue of transfer of the lands to the states is brought up again, dusted off and put forward,” he says. But there’s one big thing that makes this time around a little different, according to Cawley: the unpredictable political mood in the country right now. For a lot of Westerners, that hit home a few days before the election when a jury acquitted militia leader Ammon Bundy and his followers who led an armed occupation of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon. The Bundys said they were protesting federal ownership of public land. ”What we used to call, maybe five or six years ago, the fringe right . .. they’re starting to become more mainstream now,” says Buzz Hettick of BHA. ”That’s why we have to really ramp up the pressure we put on our politicians.” Hettick pledges that sportsmen will pressure Washington in even bigger numbers if the federal lands transfer proposal moves forward in Congress. But today, out in the Laramie range, he’s focused on a smaller quest. He’s hopped out of his pickup and set up his scoping lens on a tripod. ”If you look over at the top of this hill right over here . .. looks to be at least eight or 10 elk right there,” he says, his jaw a little clenched from the cold wind. The trip out here can be notched as a success. There are elk in these hills, maybe he’ll bag one just yet this season."
"”Free” is a word with a powerful appeal. And in the past year or so it has been tossed around a lot, followed by another word: ”college.” Both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton spent a lot of time talking about free tuition. And this week, the promise has been taken up by one of the largest public university systems in the country: New York state’s. Gov. Andrew Cuomo unveiled a proposal that would offer free tuition at   colleges for students from families earning less than $125, 000 a year. Called the Excelsior Scholarship, his plan  —   which needs approval by the Legislature  —   would grant full rides to qualifying students as long as they attend one of the state’s public   or   colleges. Cuomo’s proposal, in the lexicon of ” ” policymaking, is what’s called a ”last dollar” program. As NPR Ed explained this summer, that means students who are already eligible for federal Pell Grants must use them to pay for school. After that money is gone, the state pledges to fill in the gap. This method is the cheapest for the state, since students can draw on federal money first before taking state aid. With this type of plan, a larger share of funds from the new program is likely to go mainly to families who are relatively well off. As Robert Kelchen, a higher education scholar at Seton Hall University, explains on his blog: The benefits of the program would go to two groups of students. The first group is fairly obvious:   and    families. In New York, $125, 000 falls at roughly the 80th percentile of family income  —   an income level where families may not be able to pay tuition without borrowing, but college enrollment rates are quite high. The other group that may benefit, says Kelchen, are   students who are enticed by the clarity of the promise of ”free.” But New York’s proposal, like others, is likely to be controversial. In reality there’s no free college, just as there’s no free lunch. The real policy discussion is about how to best distribute the burden of paying for it  —   between individual families and the public at large  —   and, secondly, how to hold down the cost of providing it. All while leveraging the power of ”free” responsibly. Fueling a bubble, For many conservatives, the answer is simple. An education makes individuals richer, and individuals should bear the cost. ”The state should not subsidize intellectual curiosity,” said Ronald Reagan, back when he was running for governor of California. In recent times, the conservative position is perhaps best expressed by economist Richard Vedder, director of the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. In his books, articles and public appearances, Vedder argues that federal student aid is creating a bubble that allows colleges to raise prices indefinitely, and the only way to stop the cycle is to cut off public funding. Kevin Carey, now the director of the higher education policy program at the nonpartisan New America Foundation, made pretty much the same argument in the New Republic in 2012. He compared public universities to apple vendors: You, the apple vendor, look at the situation and say, ”Hey, the market price of an apple is still $1. Wouldn’t it be great if I could charge $1 for apples, but still get 40 cents from the government for every apple I sell?” . .. So you start raising prices by 3, 4, or 5 percent above inflation annually. In a world with no public subsidy at all for education, the only option left for free tuition would be something like the Starbucks plan  —   large corporations or wealthy donors footing the bill. And that kind of ”free” comes, generally, with a significant catch  —   like requiring students to work for a certain employer. The public piggy bank, At the other end of the political spectrum are those who see a large public obligation to pay for the education of citizens, to promote democracy, meritocracy and equal rights, among other things. They just can’t agree on how. Once upon a time, public university in this country actually was free, for the most part. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, from New York to California, states opted to charge no tuition or nominal fees. Here’s the catch. Until World War II, college was also pretty sparsely attended. In 1940, only about 5 percent of the population, most of them white men, had a bachelor’s degree. And the U. S. was the most educated nation in the world! The small numbers made tuition relatively cheap to subsidize. But starting with the GI Bill, the United States moved to a new model of ”mass” higher education. The expansion continued through the 1960s, with the Higher Education Act of 1965 establishing federal   programs. Suddenly, most high school graduates  —   men, women, black, white, new immigrants  —   aspired to a college degree. In defiance of the laws of economics, as the supply of college graduates went up, so did the demand for them, year after year. A college degree pretty much always meant you made more money. Graduates also paid more taxes, so the government got its money back in the long term  —   $6 for every dollar spent on the GI Bill, by some estimates. No such thing  Starting in the 1970s, there was a backlash to all this free money. In the economic slump, federal and state subsidies to higher education tightened. Enrollments declined. Loans, which were cheaper for the government, began to replace grants. Public universities responded to the decreased state subsidies by raising tuition. They responded to the increased availability of loan financing by raising tuition. They responded to the continued robust demand for higher education by raising tuition. They responded to the pressure to expand, adding new programs and majors and building bigger campuses, by raising tuition. Since 1978, public university tuition has climbed every single year, two or three times faster than inflation. Average student loan debt for a bachelor’s degree: $29, 400. Sara   of Temple University sums up the results of all this in a paper she wrote for the Lumina Foundation: Talented students are forgoing college because of the costs, students who start college are unable to complete because they cannot afford to continue, and even students who finish degrees may not realize all of the expected returns because of sizable debt burdens. The United States is no longer the most educated nation in the world  —   it’s the 12th. Most of the countries ahead of it have   public university options than the U. S. Perhaps most damning, the high cost of college in this country helps ensure that in too many cases, wealth trumps merit. The success rate in college for the   but   students is slightly better than the success rate for the     students. Found money,    college costs are hurting the most vulnerable. There are many different efforts to pacify the giant octopus. The new proposals bank on the fact that the federal government already spends lots of money on student aid: $47 billion in grants a year, $101 billion in loans (which are repaid) and another $20 billion in tax credits. The total of state, federal and private money going to defray the cost of tuition  —   that’s distinct from state appropriations directly to institutions  —   is $247 billion per year. Seems like with that kind of dough, there ought to be ways of buying better access and more equity. There’s substantial evidence that   students are less likely to even aspire to college because they think it’s too expensive. It affects things like their choice of math classes as early as sixth grade. That’s why so many of these programs have the word ”promise” or ”hope” in the name. The   bureaucracy is complicated to navigate. ”Free college” is a promise everyone can understand. Redeeming America’s Promise calls for offering a full scholarship to a public   or   college to every academically qualified student from families making no more than $160, 000 a year. Part of the money, they say, could come from Pell Grants and tax credits, which would no longer be needed. (This math has been challenged).   a scholar who studies access to higher education, argued in her paper last year for the Lumina Foundation that the federal   budget would and should go to pay for two years of universal free public college for all comers, including books, supplies, even a living stipend for those who need it. The fine print, Unfortunately, most attempts to defray the cost of college come with unintended consequences. For a good example, look no further than Georgia’s HOPE Scholarship. This statewide program, dating from 1993, offers high school graduates who meet certain requirements scholarships at a state university. At one time, about a dozen states had created similar models. According to this early look at the impact of the HOPE program, by Susan Dynarski for the National Bureau of Economic Research, ”Georgia’s program has likely increased the college attendance rate of all   to    by 7. 0 to 7. 9 percentage points.” Not too shabby. However, ”the evidence suggests that Georgia’s program has widened the gap in college attendance between blacks and whites and between those from   and   families.” Wait a minute. So a free tuition plan, instead of helping   and minority students, actually left them further behind? Yes, and that result has been seen in other states. It happens because these state programs require certain high school GPAs and test scores, and require that students maintain a certain GPA in college. And proportionately more   white kids meet those bars. Nothing left to lose, Most of the conversations about free college, as we’ve seen, are really about moving around piles of government money and other funds. Some folks are starting to talk about whether we can meaningfully lower the cost of delivering a college education, instead of or in addition to paying for it differently. Most of those conversations have something to do with technology. Some thought Massive Open Online Courses would be the Holy Grail: free,   college for everyone! But in that case, ”free” led to lower commitment. Completion rates for MOOCs hover around 5 to 7 percent. Blended programs, which are   and combine online learning with assistance from real people by phone or in person, seem to be able to hold down costs and get good results at the same time. Like Western Governors University, a nonprofit whose   program was the National Council of Teacher Quality’s   program in the country in 2014. It manages to charge less than the average public university without taking any public subsidy. The unique thing about education, and what makes it so hard to control the price, is that it’s not just a service or a good. It’s a process, and the learner takes an active role in creating its value. A college education may never be free, but for many people it will remain priceless. A version of this story was published on NPR Ed in June 2014."
"Updated 5:30 p. m. ET, The intelligence report on Russia’s interference in the U. S. elections concludes that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered an ”influence campaign” that aimed to help   Donald Trump. ”Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency,” the public version of the report from the FBI, the CIA and the National Security Agency states. ”We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for   Trump.” This is the first time the U. S. government has leveled these accusations directly at Putin, as NPR’s Mary Louise Kelly reports. ”It’s obviously a big deal to level that kind of charge at the head of state of a foreign country,” she says. The report does not weigh in on whether this ”influence campaign” changed the outcome of the U. S. election. Here are some of the report’s key findings: You can read the public version of the report here: On Oct. 7, the U. S. first formally accused Russia of hacking the computers of the Democratic National Committee and other U. S. political organizations. ”We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s   officials could have authorized these activities,” the joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said. Since then, intelligence officials have doubled down and expanded upon the accusations. ”We stand more resolutely on that statement,” Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Thursday during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, as NPR’s Brian Naylor reported. In December, the FBI threw its weight behind the CIA’s assessment, as NPR’s Carrie Johnson reported: ”The entire intelligence community, in fact, is now in alignment that the hacks were partly motivated to try and install Trump as president.”   Donald Trump has repeatedly dismissed the assessment. Earlier Friday afternoon, he received a briefing on the intelligence report from Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey at Trump Tower in New York. In a statement, Trump called the meeting ”constructive” and added that he has ”tremendous respect” for the work of the intelligence community. He did not specifically blame Russia, saying it was one of a number of countries including China that are ”consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our government institutions, businesses and organizations.” Trump also stated that the hacks had ”absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.” Remember, the report specifically states that it did not ”make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election.” It did say that the Department of Homeland Security ”assesses that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying.” Prior to today’s briefing, Trump told The New York Times he believes the continued attention on the cyberattacks is politically motivated. ”They got beaten very badly in the election. I won more counties in the election than Ronald Reagan,” Trump told the Times. ”They are very embarrassed about it. To some extent, it’s a witch hunt. They just focus on this.” The White House announced sanctions against Russia last month in response to the cyberattacks."
"Updated at 3:31 p. m. ET after briefing, After casting doubt on the legitimacy of U. S. intelligence (even referring to it as ”intelligence”)   Donald Trump was briefed Friday by the nation’s top intelligence officials on their investigation into Russia’s hacking attempts and interference in the U. S. presidential election. Director of National Security James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey briefed the   on their findings at Trump Tower early Friday afternoon. In a statement after the meeting, Trump called it a ”constructive” meeting, but none of it seemed to convince him that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s and Clinton campaign officials’ emails and broader attempts to try to influence the election. Instead, he noted ”Russia, China” and ”other countries” are ”consistently” trying to hack into U. S. installations. And he made sure to get in this point: ”There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.” Trump and his team continue to express doubts over accepting even the basic premise that Russia is responsible for the hacks and seem focused on the politics of opponents’ motivations. Earlier Friday, Trump dismissed the focus on Russian hacking as a ”political witch hunt.” ”China, relatively recently, hacked 20 million government names,” Trump said in an interview with the New York Times. ”How come nobody even talks about that? This is a political witch hunt.” Trump was talking about a breach of Office of Personnel Management computers two to three yeas ago. Other federal agencies and government outlets have been compromised as well  —   and those were reported on. But none of those events saw emails leaked publicly by a foreign adversary with the intent to influence an election. Trump and his team continue to defensively rail against the ”mainstream media,” seemingly believing that the real goal is to delegitimize Trump’s win. Trump is going to be the next president. He won. But national security is bigger than politics. Trump has expressed his anger on Twitter that a part of the report was leaked to The Washington Post and NBC News on Thursday night, including that U. S. intelligence ”picked up senior Russian officials” celebrating Trump’s win on election night, and that the U. S. has identified the Russians who provided the stolen Democratic emails to WikiLeaks, which published them. Trump tweeted that he is asking House and Senate committees to investigate the leak. Seventeen American agencies agree that Russia is responsible for hacking DNC and Clinton campaign official emails and leaking them to WikiLeaks. NPR has also confirmed that intelligence officials agree that Russia was doing so in an effort to undermine American democracy and with the hope that their efforts would elect Trump  —   though they didn’t expect it would actually happen. The intelligence report, which was presented to President Obama on Thursday, is expected to show the extent of Russia’s attempts to influence the election’s outcome. At a Senate hearing Thursday, Clapper said that hacking the committee’s computers and campaign chief John Podesta’s emails was just part of the Russian campaign, saying, ”It also entailed classical propaganda, disinformation, fake news.” Trump, who has been skeptical of reports of Russian involvement in the election, questioned how NBC got ”an exclusive look into the top secret report he [Obama] was presented.” Appearing on CBS This Morning, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway called it ”disappointing” that there were leaks of the report to the media before ”we actually have a report on the alleged hacking.” Conway also asserted that ”people want a lot of America to see, to believe that Russian hacking influenced the election.” On CNN, Conway continued to express doubt about the evidence, even contending that ”the idea that somehow conclusive evidence has been out there in the public domain, provided to the   is  —   is simply not true.” That ignores the fact that Trump has been declining daily intelligence briefings and is one of two people, President Obama being the other, who could ask to see all of the evidence. The 17 agencies stated unequivocally Oct. 7, two months ago, that Russia was behind the hacks  —   and that the move was ordered by the highest levels of the Russian government. Conway also insistently contended, despite the findings of the intelligence community and without having seen the evidence, that Russia didn’t want Trump elected. ”The Russians didn’t want him elected,” she boasted in that same CNN interview. ”You know why? Because he has said very clearly during the campaign and now as   that he is going to modernize our nuclear capability, that he’s going to call for an increase in defense budget, that he’s going to have oil and gas exploration, all of which goes against Russia’s economic and military interests.” So what’s really going on here? It appears what’s getting under the skin of Trump and his officials is their view that the real implication with all this is to imply, if not say outright, that Russia handed Trump the election, thereby delegitimizing his presidency. ”They got beaten very badly in the election,” Trump told the Times. ”I won more counties in the election than Ronald Reagan. They are very embarrassed about it. To some extent, it’s a witch hunt. They just focus on this.” Conway contended Friday morning in that CNN interview that ”people are conflating alleged Russian hacking with the actual outcome of the election. It’s just nonsense.” Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer echoed that frustration on Fox this past weekend, when he said there was ”zero evidence” that Russia influenced the outcome of the election. ”The way the mainstream media is playing it up is that [Russia] had an influence on the election,” Spicer said. ”There is zero evidence that they actually influenced the election.” Whether the leaked emails actually mathematically helped Trump is likely immeasurable, but that is beside the point. Trump has refused to acknowledge Russia’s role. Instead, he has consistently, over several months, in fact, cast doubt that it was Russia at all, blaming it on a   man possibly in New Jersey, or maybe it was China or maybe no one understands ”the computers” at all. ”I think we oughta get on with our lives,” Trump said. But what Trump, as the future president, seems to have trouble accepting is that this is a national security issue, not a political one. Instead, the Trump team continues to focus, be driven by and be defensive about the politics. Trump’s team seems incapable of compartmentalizing and messaging on this basic point: that accepting the premise that Russia is responsible is not the same as saying it handed Trump the presidency. Maybe Trump began some acceptance of this Friday. He also told the Times, ”With all that being said, I don’t want countries to be hacking our country.” Trump said he had ”tremendous respect” for the intelligence community, but right now, the country is in a very strange position of having an incoming American president who, it seems, would rather believe adversaries over American intelligence when it contradicts his predisposed world view  —   or is in line with his domestic political opponents."
"Updated at 8:00 p. m. ET Saturday, The U. S. Attorney has charged Esteban Santiago, the man in custody for carrying out the deadly shooting at Fort   International Airport in Florida on Friday afternoon. At least five people were killed and six others were injured in the shooting, according to the Broward County Sheriff’s Office. The suspect, Esteban Santiago, had been taken into custody ”without incident” by a sheriff’s deputy immediately after the shooting, Sheriff Scott Israel said at a news conference. Israel had said earlier in the day that ”at this point it looks like he acted alone.” The charges issued include: ”Performing an act of violence against a person at an airport,” ”using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence” and ”causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm in the course of a violation.” The maximum penalty carried with these charges is a possible death sentence. Santiago will have his initial appearance Monday at 11:00 a. m. before United States Magistrate Judge Alicia O. Valle in Fort Lauderdale. Authorities said Santiago took flights from Alaska to Minnesota, finally landing in Fort Lauderdale, where he took a firearm out of his checked baggage and ”began indiscriminately shooting,” as Israel put it. Santiago was interviewed extensively by FBI and Broward County sheriff’s office officials, Sheriff Israel said. George Piro, special agent in charge of the Miami field office, said at the news conference that it was too soon to say what the motive behind the attack was. ”We’re not ruling out anything, including the terrorism angle,” he said, adding that it was ”too early to truly know why he came to Florida.” Piro confirmed reports that Santiago, 26, had voluntarily gone to the FBI office in Anchorage in November and spoken with agents. News reports have said the suspect complained that an outside force was controlling his mind. Piro noted that the suspect stated that he didn’t intend to harm anyone. ”We looked at his contacts,” said Piro, ”did interagency checks and closed our assessment.” He says the agents turned Santiago over to local police, who took him for a mental health evaluation. NPR has not confirmed any details of the suspect’s mental health issues. Piro didn’t confirm news reports that Santiago was involved in a fight before the shootings. ”I’m not aware of an incident on the flight or at baggage claim,” he said. Sheriff Scott Israel described the weapon used in the attack as a   handgun and said it was too early in the investigation to say how many rounds were fired. The sheriff said the attacker didn’t make any statements while shooting. In addition to the victims who were killed or wounded by bullets, Israel said, some 30 to 40 people were taken to hospitals with other injuries. The airport aviation director, Mark Gale, estimated that authorities will have helped about 10, 000 people with transportation, food and lodging because of the incident. Police Chief Jesse Davis of Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport says Santiago departed the Alaska facility on a Delta flight, having left a firearm in his checked baggage, as required. Davis tells NPR’s Richard Gonzales that Santiago did not draw attention to himself at the airport, was not previously known to the airport police and apparently was traveling alone. According to NPR’s Tom Bowman, Santiago is a    former soldier. Tom tells our Newscast unit: ”Military records show Santiago received a general discharge  —   rather than the top honorable discharge  —   from the Alaska National Guard in August because of poor performance . .. ”Santiago received an honorable discharge from the Puerto Rico National Guard in 2013 and served with those soldiers in Iraq in 2010 and 2011. He was a combat engineer, a job that includes clearing roads and detecting mines.” Tom reports that a U. S. official familiar with the investigation says, while serving with the Alaska National Guard, Santiago ”was AWOL on a number of occasions, would miss drills and was interviewed by Army criminal investigators at times for what they called ’strange behavior.’ ” Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who traveled to Fort Lauderdale on Friday afternoon, told reporters he had not asked the federal government for resources and had not attempted to contact President Obama. The governor said he had reached out to   Donald Trump and Vice   Mike Pence, who take office later this month. Later, Scott’s press office announced that he spoke with Obama following the news conference. National Security Council spokesperson Ned Price said the president ”extended his sincere condolences to the families and other loved ones of those killed,” said his ”thoughts and prayers are with the wounded,” and gave assurances that federal authorities would continue to help in the investigation. Israel said authorities were not releasing any information about the identities of those killed and injured. The sheriff’s office tweeted that those who were injured had been taken to a local hospital. Israel and Gale both said there was no evidence any shots had been fired elsewhere in the airport or by anyone except the suspect in custody. Previous reports had indicated there might have been additional shots fired on the airport property. Broward County Fire Rescue told the local CBS affiliate in Miami that a shooting was reported around 1 p. m. ET. The sheriff’s office tweeted that it received a call about a shooting at the airport around 12:55 p. m. The airport said on Twitter that: ”There is an ongoing incident in Terminal 2, Baggage Claim.” The airport has four   terminals, of which Terminal 2 is the smallest. It serves Air Canada and Delta Airlines. People who said they were inside the airport described seeing people running. Among those inside was former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who tweeted that ”everyone is running” after shots were fired, and that police said there was one shooter and multiple victims. Shortly after 1 p. m. Fleischer tweeted that police were not letting anyone out of the part of the airport he was in. Television images showed hundreds of travelers standing around the part of the airport where the planes park. The airport said it had temporarily suspended all services and asked travelers to contact air carriers directly about flight information. The Federal Aviation Administration said a ground stop was in effect at the airport due to the incident. In a statement about two hours after the shooting was reported, the FAA said flights were ”not arriving or departing” from the airport. The airport reopened Saturday at 5 a. m. according to The Associated Press, with many flights delayed or canceled. This is a breaking news story. As often happens in situations like these, some information reported early may turn out to be inaccurate. We’ll move quickly to correct the record and we’ll only point to the best information we have at the time."
"North Korea got 2017 off to a menacing start. In his New Year’s address, supreme leader Kim Jong Un warned that the nation was in the ”final stage” of preparations to test an intercontinental ballistic missile. A day later,   Donald Trump said the North would never develop a nuclear weapon capable of striking the U. S. ”It won’t happen!” Trump tweeted. Bombast aside, independent arms control experts agree that North Korea is moving rapidly to develop an ICBM. And many suspect it will test a missile capable of reaching the continental U. S. later this year. ”They are very far along in their ICBM testing project,” says Melissa Hanham, an East Asia researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. ”Probably we will see that they will do a flight test in 2017.” If the test were successful  —   a big if  —   North Korea would join a small club of nations with ICBMs, including superpowers like the U. S. Russia and China. North Korea is a notoriously closed society, but the government periodically releases images and videos of its missiles. Analysts pore over that scant material and use it to cobble together a mosaic of the North’s weapons program. Those reports, combined with public statements by officials in South Korea and the U. S. provide some sense of the North’s progress. And there was a lot of progress in 2016, Hanham says: ”There were so many tests, I need crib notes.” North Korea tested a new rocket engine, based on a Soviet design, that is more powerful than anything it has used before. It also tested a heat shield of the type needed to protect a nuclear warhead as it   Earth’s atmosphere. In June, it successfully fired a new Musudan missile. The Musudan’s range of up to 2, 500 miles is short of what’s needed to reach the U. S. but it appears to use some of the technology that would probably go into a larger ICBM. That ICBM has yet to be tested. Known to analysts as the   or   (”one of the challenges with North Korean missiles is that they don’t tell us what they’re called,” says Hanham) it first appeared in a military parade in 2012. Back then, the missile was so kludged together, it looked to some experts like it could be a decoy. But in the years since, photos of the ICBM showed features that suggest it is becoming a real weapon. The missile began as a clunky,   design, says David Wright, a rocketry expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists. It has since been redesigned as a simpler   affair. With the new engines tested this year, it would have a range of about 7, 500 miles, Wright says. ”That would start to bring things like Washington, D. C. into range.” Can Trump stop the test? Neither Hanham nor Wright thinks there are easy solutions available to the  . Attacking the missile before it’s launched would be an act of war. If the ICBM is tested to the south, as happened with North Korea’s space launches, then it will be out of range of the main U. S.   system based in Alaska. Smaller   interceptors are also unlikely to be able to shoot it down, Wright says. That leaves diplomacy, says Hanham. But Kim Jong Un has shown little willingness to negotiate. ”There are no good options, really,” Hanham says. ”That’s why previous administrations have struggled with it for so long.” A flight test will not mean that North Korea can conduct a nuclear strike on U. S. soil. For one thing, the North’s track record in testing new missiles is pretty bad, says Wright. He estimates the odds that this new ICBM will work are ”probably less than 50 percent.” And while the individual components may all be there, they still need to be combined into a single weapon, he adds. Many analysts believe the North has miniaturized its nuclear bomb. But Wright says it’s less clear whether a North Korean nuke could survive the   of a missile launch. Similarly, its   system for bringing the weapon back to earth could be highly inaccurate in its current design. Perfecting an ICBM as a weapon may take several more years. Still, Hanham believes that 2017 may be a watershed year for the North. Even an unsuccessful ICBM test would send a clear message. ”That’s going to be really scary,” she says, ”not just for the region, but the American public.”"
"Donald Trump is still two weeks from his presidential inauguration, but new Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer sounds ready to do battle with a   Senate, House and White House. ”We’re going to hold Donald Trump’s feet to the fire,” the New York Democrat told NPR’s Audie Cornish on All Things Considered while sitting in front of the fireplace near his desk. ”Our job is going to be to hold Donald Trump and the Republican majority accountable.” Schumer hasn’t quite moved into his suite of Capitol offices. Boxes are heaped in corridors and naked hooks poke from the walls of Schumer’s ornate chambers on the second floor. Just outside the windows is the inaugural podium being built and beyond it, the National Mall. Inside, amid the clutter, the new Senate minority leader is wasting no time defending Democratic policies and programs from the incoming administration and its congressional allies, even if he has less leverage than he had hoped to have. Schumer hinted at the Democrats’ relatively weak position, as Republicans move quickly to repeal Obamacare. He repeatedly said Democrats would not cooperate with any Affordable Care Act replacement if the GOP pushes ahead with repeal, but then allowed that ”there might be a thing or two” in competing Republican plans he finds appealing. He also brought negotiations into the open by putting public pressure on GOP senators from Maine and Alaska to vote against repeal. ”Now they want to eliminate the funding of Planned Parenthood,” he said, referring to a plan by House Speaker Paul Ryan to include such provisions in legislation undoing Obamacare, ”so people like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are having some qualms about this.” Schumer hinted at some of the legislative maneuvers Democrats may employ to stymie Obamacare repeal. ”We’ll have an amendment on the floor of the Senate, as we debate ACA,” he explained, ”that quotes Donald Trump and says we’re opposed to cutting health care  —   Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security for that matter.” Before his intelligence briefing today, the   told the New York Times that the attention devoted to Russian attempts to influence the election is ”a political witch hunt.” Schumer called that ”flip and glib.” ”Before you even get the briefing, you come to a conclusion  —   that’s not the way to govern,” he said. ”And I have said . .. that we can’t have a Twitter presidency. This is serious stuff, this governing, and to just be flip and glib and tweet . .. you’ve got to do a lot more. And certainly any president  —   Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative  —   should keep an open mind until they get the briefing.” Schumer also responded to Trump’s calling him a ”clown.” ”I didn’t tweet back a name  —   that’s derogating the debate,” Schumer said. ”I said I understand your anguish, Mr.   because you don’t know what to replace the ACA with. But instead of calling names, roll up your sleeves and come up with a replacement. So I’m not going to descend to  .”"
"Bernie Sanders thinks he has a pretty good idea why Hillary Clinton and Democrats lost in the 2016 election. ”Look, you can’t simply go around to wealthy people’s homes raising money and expect to win elections,” the Vermont senator, who gave Clinton a surprisingly strong run for the Democratic nomination, told NPR’s David Greene in an interview airing on Morning Edition. ”You’ve got to go out and mix it up and be with ordinary people.” That picks up on a criticism of Clinton devoting too much time to fundraising  —   and not enough to    campaigning in traditionally Democratic states, like Michigan and Wisconsin. In the general election, Clinton never visited Wisconsin after she became the nominee and visited Michigan late in the game. The two Upper Midwestern states swung narrowly to Trump: Wisconsin by slightly more than 20, 000 votes and Michigan by slightly more than 10, 000. During the primary, Sanders boasted of his   donations. ”The Democratic Party swallowed the bait,” he argued. ”They became hooked on big money.” The Vermont senator added that he believes Democrats have lost touch with the needs of everyday Americans. ”I happen to believe that the Democratic Party has been not doing a good job in terms of communicating with people in cities, in towns and in rural America, all over this country,” he said. Some have blamed Sanders, in part, however for Clinton’s loss. Young voters were drawn to his campaign, but many chose a   candidate in the general election. Although Sanders campaigned for Clinton, at times he had a hard time voicing   support for her. The kind of harsh criticism he leveled of Clinton on her Wall Street speeches and decrying her as part of the status quo, rather than building up her beliefs and policies (that certainly stand in stark contrast to Donald Trump) has irked party loyalists. That’s especially true, considering that although Sanders ran in the Democratic primary and caucuses with Democrats, he has declined to put the ”D” next to his name. He is back in the Senate as an independent. Sanders believes Trump’s message resonated with workers, like the ones in Wisconsin and Michigan, who were hit hard by the economic recession and haven’t yet recovered. It was a connection Democrats were largely unable to maintain. ”One of the reasons that Mr. Trump won is that we have millions of people who have given up on the political process, who don’t believe that Congress is listening to their pain,” Sanders said. ”What the Democratic Party has got to do is start listening.” In that way, Trump and Sanders are alike. Both tapped into the   current that permeated the 2016 election. When asked if he thought he would have been able to win the general election against Trump, Sanders brushed it off. ”I don’t think it helps to relive history,” said Sanders, whose campaign team touted polling during the primary that showed him faring better against Trump in    matchups. ”The answer is I don’t know. Nobody knows. It’s not worth speculating about. We are where we are.” Sanders sees Trump’s   tendencies as a potential opportunity, at least when it comes to the fight to preserve Medicare and Medicaid. Trump promised repeatedly throughout the campaign that he would not cut Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security if elected. Sanders wants to hold Trump accountable for that promise, regardless of what Republicans in Congress want to do. Sanders says Trump has a choice: ”Either he can have the courage and get up in front of the American people, or do it through a tweet, and say, ’You know what? Hey, I was just kidding. I was really lying. ’” Or Trump can tell his fellow Republicans that they’re wasting their time on legislation that cuts those programs. ”That would be the right thing to do,” Sanders said. ”And I look forward to Trump telling the American people that that is what he intends to do.” To press the issue, Sanders, along with congressional leaders, is calling on his colleagues to organize Jan. 15 rallies protesting threats to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Medicaid."
"Right now, a big chunk of Antarctic ice is hanging on by a frozen thread. British researchers monitoring the crack in the Larsen C ice shelf say that only about 12 miles now connect the chunk of ice to the rest of the continent. ”After a few months of steady, incremental advance since the last event, the rift grew suddenly by a further 18 km [11 miles] during the second half of December 2016,” wrote Adrian Luckman in a statement Thursday by the MIDAS Project, which is monitoring changes in the area. The crack in question has been growing for years and is now a total of roughly 70 miles long. When the fissure reaches the far side of the shelf, an iceberg the size of Delaware will float off, leaving the Larsen C 10 percent smaller. ”This event will fundamentally change the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula,” Luckman wrote. Ice shelves are important because they provide a buffer between the sea and the ice that sits on land, in this case on the Antarctic Peninsula. Without a healthy ice shelf, water from melting glaciers can flow straight to the sea, raising the sea level. It’s normal for the front of an ice shelf to crack and break off, known as calving. But it’s unusual for that to happen faster than the ice shelf can refreeze. Some scientists worry that the missing piece will destabilize the whole ice shelf. A smaller ice shelf, Larsen B, completely splintered in a little over a month in 2002, a process that started with a similar crack. Another ice shelf, Larsen A, had disintegrated a few years before. ”Larsen C may eventually follow the example of its neighbour Larsen B,” wrote Luckman. ”If it doesn’t go in the next few months, I’ll be amazed,” he told BBC News. Larsen C is Antarctica’s   ice shelf."
"Michelle Obama used her last official White House speech to deliver a passionate pep talk to the nation’s young people, especially immigrants, Muslims and others who might feel slighted by the incoming Trump administration. ”Do not ever let anyone make you feel like you don’t matter,” the first lady said, ”or like you don’t have a place in our American story, because you do.” Obama spoke at a celebration of school counselors from around the country. The annual event is one of a number of steps along with ”college signing day” that Obama and her husband have taken to encourage students to pursue higher education. ”Because let’s be honest,” the first lady said. ”If we’re always shining the spotlight on professional athletes or recording artists or Hollywood celebrities, if those are the only achievements we celebrate, then why would we ever think kids would see college as a priority?” A graduate of Harvard Law School like her husband, Michelle Obama stressed that to preserve and protect their freedoms, young people should get a good education, so they can be active and productive citizens. She added young people should not lose hope, even when they encounter the inevitable obstacles. ”It is our fundamental belief in the power of hope that has allowed us to rise above the voices of doubt and division, of anger and fear that we have faced in our own lives and the life of this country,” Obama said. ”Our hope that if we work hard enough and believe in ourselves, we can be whatever we dream, regardless of the limitations that others may place on us.” At times, others have tried to place limits on Michelle Obama herself. In a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey last month, Obama described her surprise at being tagged during her husband’s first White House campaign as an ”angry black woman.” ”Wow, where did that come from?” Obama told Winfrey. ”I thought, ’Let me live my life out loud so that people can then see and then judge for themselves.’ ” After eight years in the White House, the first lady has won a favorable judgment from most Americans. She enjoys higher favorability ratings than her husband does. On Friday, she encouraged young people to be focused and determined, not afraid. ”When people see us for who we truly are, maybe, just maybe they, too, will be inspired to rise to their best possible selves,” Obama said. With her voice breaking, Obama recalled how her own father worked hard at a city water plant, hoping that one day his children would go to college and have opportunities he never dreamed of. ”That’s the kind of hope that every single one of us  —   politicians, parents, preachers, all of us  —   need to be providing for our young people,” Obama said. ”Because that is what moves this country forward every single day. Our hope for the future and the hard work that hope inspires.” ”That’s my final message to young people as first lady,” she said as the audience in the White House East Room stood and applauded. ”Lead by example with hope, never fear. And know that I will be with you, rooting for you and working to support you for the rest of my life.”"
"Counselors play a big role in helping students succeed: They help with scheduling, college applications and with issues like mental health. Since 2015, first lady Michelle Obama has honored a school counselor of the year in a ceremony at the White House. Friday, the honor goes to Terri Tchorzynski of the Calhoun Area Career Center in Battle Creek, Mich. where she works with   and   drawn from 20 public high schools in Calhoun County. Tchorzynski started her career as a high school English teacher, before getting her master’s degree in counseling  —   a role she says she ”always knew she wanted.” NPR Ed caught up with Tchorzynski about her work in Michigan and the important role she sees counselors playing in schools. Is it true that school counselors don’t like the term ”guidance counselor” anymore? Can you explain that? We use the term ”school counselor” now. We cringe when we hear the term ”guidance counselor.” It’s kind of that   model from years ago, the, ”I’m gonna guide you towards your college or career.” It’s from when people didn’t really understand what was going on with the whole realm of school counseling. But now with a school counselor, we’re much more than just the guidance counselor. So what is the role of a school counselor? There are three ways to break it down. First is college and career readiness, preparing our students for what life looks like after high school. If it’s college, then getting them focused on FAFSA completion, college scholarships and being academically ready. If it’s for a career, figuring out what pathways are appropriate for them and what careers are available to them that fit their interests and their skills. Second, we work in the   domain. This is more dealing with behavior, or with personal problems that students may have that impact their education. So we help them through those things so they can be successful in school. Third, we’ll call the academic domain. This is working with attendance or grades, or making sure students have enough credits to graduate high school. So we are people that work in mental health, that work in the academic domains, that work in college and career readiness. We use data! How do you use data? Can you give me an example? We use a lot of data in our building, so that our stakeholders have a clear picture of what we’re doing in the counseling department. Here’s an example about modifying behavior. At the beginning of every single school year we do presentations for every single one of our students about bullying and harassment, because we know that it’s an issue in our schools and it’s an issue with our students and we want to make sure that it’s addressed early. And then we start monitoring behavior referrals. Before we started all this, the behavior referrals were not set up a certain way. But as a counseling department, we wanted to know specifically, if there’s a behavior issue that’s connected to bullying or harassment, we want it marked. So we can start identifying if there are issues in certain programs  —   we don’t have classrooms, instead we call them programs. We created this tag in our student data system, so any time a referral went through about bullying and harassment, we were flagged. We could see when and where there were incidents and tailored our interventions based on that data. We’ve pulled out certain groups and done some positive support groups for specific students too. What’s one thing you’ve learned as a school counselor? A lot of times it’s very easy to get centered in on the students who come to your office all the time or the students that are very outgoing. They’re the A students that just want additional support. But there’s a large population of students that just don’t know to ask for help. Maybe they are     and so they don’t even know what they need to know in order to go to school. So I think it’s so important for counselors to think about the students that maybe don’t have a voice. We need to be the voice for students that don’t have the voice. It’s my job as a counselor to make sure that all these students, regardless of race, ethnicity, income or what kind of backgrounds they come from, it’s my job to give them the same support. So sometimes I may be more intentional about reaching out to those students because I know they won’t be the ones that are coming to me first. So I guess the advice is  —   be proactive. We’ve reported about the mental health crisis in our nation’s schools  —   and it’s important to note how important counselors are in helping students with those types of problems. Oh, definitely. Having our students and our families understand that that’s part of our role, is important. Some people just don’t understand that it is a part of what we do. It’s not just writing letters of recommendation and telling students where they should go to college. There’s also a big part of our jobs as counselors that focuses on the   side . .. there is a huge need for that now. We have those community contacts, so if I have families that are uncertain about local community agencies and how they can help, part of my role is to connect them with those agencies. What has been the biggest challenge in your career so far? As a school counselor I think the   part is really hard. It’s hard because students go through a lot of difficult things in their lives. And so when you’re dealing with student tragedies  —   student death or violence  —   or just the things some teenagers have to face, that’s really difficult. In my setting as a school counselor, there’s only so much that I can do. The more we can connect with outside agencies, that helps too, so then I can refer them out to a community agency that can help them even further. But that’s a difficult part of the job. It’s something I don’t think I’ll ever get used to, because it’s challenging and sad. There’s a lot of things that our students have to deal with that are really difficult. Can you give me some examples of the things that have come up in the last seven years? Last year was a really difficult year for us. We had quite a few student tragedies. We actually lost one of our students to a car accident, and that obviously impacted all of us in our building. We have students that do   and suicide, unfortunately. A lot of what I see nowadays with teenagers is just homelessness and poverty. I have a lot of students that are   or    and for whatever reason, they just they can’t live in their home, and so they need to find somewhere else to live. Sometimes, they’re living with different friends, living day to day. That’s always a struggle, because as a counselor, I want them to be successful, but at the same time, they’re dealing with poverty and homelessness and trying to figure out where they are supposed to stay that night. So what keeps your spirits up? I just know that as a counselor, that’s why I’m there. That’s my role. The more students can trust me, and know that that is part of what I do and that I can help support them, the better. I always tell them, ”I don’t have this magic pill that makes everything go away.” But I’m a resource for them to help them in whatever it is that they need. Unfortunately, school counselors can be rare. In Michigan, where you’re from, the student to school counselor ratio is 732 to 1. The American School Counselor Association recommends a ratio of 250 to 1. Clearly, that’s far from the norm. What are your thoughts on that? When you think about the personnel you have in your schools, school counselors are the ones that play the role in regards to impacting academic behavior and attendance. So if you don’t have a school counselor in your building, then there is a certain person that plays all of those roles and puts all those pieces together. It’s so important for people to understand that counselors are needed at every single level, kindergarten through 12th grade. Elementary students have just as many needs, so it’s just as important to establish early what a school counselor can do for students, In Michigan, elementary school counselors are very rare. In our county I think we have one school district that has one. In my own kids’ school, they have one that will float between three or four buildings. Counselors just can’t offer the services that are needed for those students when they just have such large caseloads."
"Prolific Indian actor Om Puri, who for decades appeared in films all over the world, has died at age 66 in Mumbai. Reports say Puri suffered a heart attack at his home early on Friday. Puri had roles in more than 300 movies in his career, NPR’s Rose Friedman reports for our Newscast unit. Rose says he began acting in Indian art house cinema in the 1970s and soon branched into British and American films, including Gandhi in 1982 and Charlie Wilson’s War in 2007. He appeared in the 2013 film The Reluctant Fundamentalist, in which he played a father struggling to pass on a sense of empathy to his Wall   son. Most recently, he starred alongside Helen Mirren in The   Journey, a 2015 film about a displaced Indian family that settles in a French village and opens a restaurant. Puri was a crossover star, as evidenced by the breadth of people mourning his death. The BBC reported that even media in Pakistan, with whom India’s relationship is often tense, are celebrating his life and career. The BBC wrote, ”[Puri] had recently spoken out against the ban imposed by India on Pakistani actors working in Bollywood films, following tensions over Kashmir,” telling an Indian TV channel, ”Pakistani artists are not terrorists.” In 2004, Puri received an honorary Order of the British Empire, an award established by King George V and given to individuals who have made distinguished contributions in their field. In 1990, he was awarded the Padma Shri, one of India’s highest civilian honors, the Guardian wrote. Puri’s professional life was wildly successful, but his personal life had been turbulent in recent years. He separated from his wife, Nandita, after she wrote his biography in 2009, called Unlikely Hero: Om Puri. The book revealed explicit details about his sexual forays as a young man. Puri is survived by Nandita, whom he married in 1993, and their son. Less than a month before his death, Puri took to Twitter to reflect on his life and career:"
"It’s a fantasy that goes back centuries: a message in a bottle, carried ashore from   lands. Authors, artists and children alike have dreamed of such a gift from the sea. This time, though, it’s not a bottle that washes ashore. It’s eggs  —   thousands of little toy eggs. That’s what happened on the German island of Langeoog this week. Perched just off the North Sea coast, it found itself buffeted by an invasion of multicolored plastic eggs  —   much to the delight of local children, because the eggs contained toys. Police for the Lower Saxony region of Germany tweeted the evidence. Der Spiegel reports that police suspect the eggs came from a freighter that lost part of its cargo during an intense storm, which the BBC calls the worst to hit Germany’s northeastern coast since 2006. At any rate, what was lost now has been found, by many of the community’s littlest residents. The local mayor, Uwe Garrels, soon allowed the town’s local kindergartners to go pick up the toys, according to Deutsche Welle. ”The surprise eggs have found their way to freedom,” Garrels said, according to the news service, which cited broadcaster NDR. Of course, the joy of the moment wore off soon. ”At first I thought this was a wonder, because everything was so colorful and so on, but then we realized that this is a huge mess in the end,” Garrels said, according to The Associated Press. He also noted the plastic bags and other materials that have washed ashore on the island. (All of which, it must be said, can cause some very real problems for wildlife.) Still, all these little eggs contained an extra treat with their toys. Like the immortal bottle, they bore notes from afar. There was just one problem for the German children who received them: They were written in Russian."
"A Canadian doctor who is opposed to a widely used drug for morning sickness has fired another volley. Writing in the journal PLOS ONE, Dr. Navindra Persaud in the department of family and community medicine at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, notes that an unpublished study that supported use of the drug, conducted in the 1970s, is seriously flawed. On the one hand, this paper is a triumph for scientific openness. Pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies often guard this information, making it difficult for scientists to draw independent conclusions about   research. And there are stories about drugs that have managed to get onto the market based on overly rosy interpretations of study results (think Vioxx, the   drug that was later pulled after it was linked to higher risk for heart disease). Academic researchers have been pushing for greater openness when it comes to raw data. But because the study was never published, it wasn’t even subject to the scrutiny of peer review back in the day. The study plays a peripheral role in determining the safety and efficacy of the drug, which was approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration in 2013. That new drug application made its case based on other studies, not the flawed data from decades ago. But the FDA did review the previous history of this drug, including the study that Persaud has called into question, and considered it supporting evidence. The FDA had no qualms about the safety of this drug, marketed in the United States as Diclegis. It’s a combination of two common    medications: an antihistamine and vitamin B6. There’s actually a long backstory about this pairing. In the 1950s, a somewhat different formulation that had three principal ingredients was marketed as Bendectin. In the   the drugmaker dropped one of the ingredients. But that came off the U. S. market in 1983. Lawyers saw the drug as a potentially rich target for product liability cases, and the drug company ultimately pulled the drug off the market to avoid lawsuits, rather than out of actual safety concerns. The Canadian company, Duchesnay, continued to market a generic version of the drug, rebranded as Diclectin in Canada. (It also makes Diclegis.) For every two pregnancies in Canada, doctors write one prescription for Diclectin, according to Persaud. The drug was heavily promoted by a prominent Canadian researcher, Dr. Gideon Koren, at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. He received funding from Duchesnay. According to an   story in Maclean’s magazine, Persaud felt Koren had gone too far in pushing this drug. ”We are trying to provide patients and doctors with access to complete and accurate information so that they can make informed decisions,” Persaud told Shots in an email. ”This information may lead regulators like the FDA and Health Canada to revisit previous decisions,” he added. ”Patients and their clinicians may also make different decisions based on this information.” The FDA told Shots that it is reviewing the PLOS ONE paper. The drug has not been as heavily used in the United States (though the company did hire Kim Kardashian to promote it on social media, which drew a rebuke from the FDA). The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says pregnant women with morning sickness shouldn’t reach hastily for the pill bottle. It recommends first that women take a multivitamin eat dry toast or crackers drink fluids avoid bad smells, and take other basic steps to reduce morning sickness. Only if those measures fail does the group recommend a doctor’s visit to ask about the prescription. And women taking that step should be aware that, while the FDA approved the drug (to be prescribed only after simpler measures have been tried and found wanting) reviewers there weren’t impressed by its effectiveness, noting ”the treatment effect is small.” Using a   measure of nausea and vomiting called the PUQE score (who says scientists are humorless!) women taking Diclectin reported a 4. 7 point improvement, versus a 3. 9 point improvement for women taking placebo. So the drug was only marginally better than a placebo, but that was good enough for FDA approval.  You can email Richard Harris at rharris@npr. org."
"Russia’s recent cyber adventures have the hallmarks of an old Soviet specialty: disinformation. While many Americans have just awoken to the world of disinformation  —   sometimes known as ”fake news”  —   in the recent presidential election, Moscow’s efforts date back decades and have become increasingly prominent over the past decade as techniques have been updated for the digital age. The spread of disinformation through active measures was a central tactic of Soviet information operations as a way to influence foreign governments and their populations, undermine relations between nations, and weaken those who opposed communism. Dezinformatsiya, as Russians call it, is meant to instill fear and confuse audiences, blurring the lines between truth, falsehood and reality. Disinformation can spread conspiracy theories and reinforce ”filter bubbles” that isolate readers and viewers from alternative viewpoints and can create a cloud of confusion and paranoia. Spreading disinformation, I recently led an independent study on how Russia uses disinformation to influence ethnic Russians who live in former Soviet Union states. In our report, we highlight how disinformation is effective because it is quick, cheap and yields high rewards. We assessed that Russia has a number of tools in its disinformation toolbox  —   including its   Russian and   television network Russian Television, platforms such as the Sputnik news service that enable audiences outside Russia to subscribe to their services free of charge, and the deployment of trolls in the blogosphere and on social media. In some instances, Russia’s troll armies manage multiple fake accounts, and each account posts articles on social media 50 to 100 times a day. Even before the explosion of social media, the effects of Russia’s modern disinformation efforts could be seen during the 2008   war, when Russia used picture defacement to spread fake images and news stories. Russia hacked into Georgian infrastructure and the official website of   President Mikhail Saakashvili. More recently, in Ukraine, Russia spread many conspiracy theories and fake stories in 2014, during the Crimea crisis and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. In the latter case, Western sources have pointed to a Russian missile being involved and believe it was fired by either the Russians themselves or Ukrainian separatists allied with Moscow. Possible consequences, If unaddressed, Russia’s disinformation tactics will have at least three significant consequences for global stability. First, Russia’s disinformation machinery could inspire other countries, terrorists, transnational criminal organizations and individuals to emulate this behavior. An immediate effect could be attempts to disrupt the coming elections in Germany, France, Serbia, and the Netherlands. Different groups act for different reasons. Some purveyors of disinformation, like the Islamic State, have ideological motives. Others look at it as an easy way to make an extra dollar. In Macedonia, for example, young people found it lucrative to set up websites to share fake news that interfered with the U. S. election. Their motives were more economic than political. Second, disinformation can bleed into conspiracy theories that can instantly spread on social media and may have major national security implications. In December, Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad tweeted incorrectly that Israel was threatening Pakistan with nuclear weapons after this disinformation appeared on AWD News, a   website. While the Israeli Defense Ministry questioned this claim, the defense minister’s tweet was reposted hundreds of times, spreading fake content within a matter of seconds. Earlier in December, stolen emails containing a brief exchange between John Podesta and the owner of a pizzeria, Comet Ping Pong, in Washington, D. C. led to a fake news story that a child sex ring was being run out of the restaurant. A North Carolina man then drove to Washington and fired a gun, saying he wanted to rescue sex slaves he was convinced were harbored at the restaurant. Identifying disinformation, Third, Russia’s disinformation campaigns help highlight one of the biggest and most dangerous challenges in Western society: an inability to think critically about information. In a   news cycle and   universe, media consumers have developed an unprecedented need to access, process and spread information, be it true or not. But the youth in particular have a limited ability to identify fake news content. If information seems newsworthy and provides high entertainment value, few people will think hard before tweeting it out or posting it on Facebook. The challenge is further amplified when notable figures spread disinformation via social media, reinforcing the virtual conspiracy bubble. And when disinformation comes from those believed to be credible  —   such as friends, family and colleagues  —   it is even more likely to be treated uncritically, as factual information. Countering Russia’s disinformation will require a set of actions including debunking fake news, messaging and creating counternarratives for targeted populations both in the U. S. and globally who are sympathetic to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s policies and strengthening individual and media literacy programs around the world. The muddling mix of rumors, lies and news has dominated our conversation to the point that we are no longer certain what is true. Citizens, news and social media outlets, both organizations and users, cannot fall victim to disinformation. We have a responsibility to think critically about the information and stories that are disseminated. Without doing so, we will continue to empower Russia and others to spread disinformation and propaganda, risk our security and create distrust in our society.

"After a woman was   and died of her injuries in New Delhi in December 2012, the Indian government tried to set up swift and judicious ways to report and address such crimes. Fast track courts were set up, social workers and police were given sensitization training. Women were told things would be better when they stepped out.   four years and the country is buzzing angrily at how much has not changed. Women bringing in the new year in downtown Bangalore, the country’s cosmopolitan IT hub, were surrounded and groped by mobs of pushing, shoving, handsy men. Photos and videos captured that night show young women trying to push through crowds of up to 300 men pressing in on them. Some of the women were crying, some yelling, others were being defended by their friends. Many of the women said they used their shoes to beat off gropers. A short distance away, an emcee walked out of his event and stumbled upon 25 men threatening a group of women. According to some women on the scene, not only was the harassment frightening, the apathy of cops who looked away and didn’t intervene was worse. In the days that have followed, the official stance on the mass harassment has done somersaults. First the police vowed to punish the offenders and called on the victims to file police complaints. Three days later, the police said they found no street camera footage to support the claims of sexual harassment, although the police commissioner has since said there is ”credible evidence” of the attacks. And then came the remarks of home minister G. Parameshwara, one of the highest ranking officials in the state of Karnataka, of which Bangalore is the capital. He went on record to say: ”Youngsters . .. try to copy the Westerners not only in the mindset but even the dressing. So some disturbance, some girls are harassed, these kind of things do happen.” On January 3, Abu Azmi of Mumbai, the state leader of a political party, said on national TV: ”If my sister or daughter is roaming around on December 31 with random men who aren’t their husband or brother, I don’t think that’s right.” He added, ”If there’s petrol near fire, it will burn. If there is sugar, ants will come.” His words were highlighted in angry tweets. Trisha Shetty, a lawyer, is the   of SheSays, a nonprofit group that educates young women about their rights, especially in the areas of sexual violence. She said the responses from officials were reprehensible. ”We reject this sense of entitlement men have over women’s bodies, sexuality and spaces,” she said. And, she added, the display of such parochial mindsets from people in charge of ensuring safety in public spaces is a huge setback for women. Meanwhile, on social media the #NotAllMen hashtag started to trend the next day defending men who didn’t do it, arguing that women were generalizing their anger. Japleen Pasricha, who runs the Feminism in India platform, was a critic of #NotAllMen tweets: ”The #NotAllMen tag detracted from the conversation, hijacked the narrative, and moved it away from how to deal with what’s happening. We’re not saying all men do this, but we do know all women are harassed.” To counter it, Feminism In India and Pasricha dusted off the globally used #YesAllWomen hashtag. Their tweet inviting Indian women to share their stories of public harassment, assault and abuse has been retweeted more than 900 times, with at least 1, 000 responses, says Pasricha. Sharing stories publicly may not change too many minds (although one Twitter troll changed his handle to ”I’m sorry” after being taken to task for sexism) m says Pasricha, ”But, mainly we wanted to take the narrative back.” A petition has been floated demanding unconditional apologies from the politicians, and on January 21 solidarity marches will be held in seven cities: Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune and Kolkata, organized and supported by 18 organizations, including Take Back the Night and Why Loiter, under the umbrella hashtag #IWillGoOut2017, Will a march make a difference? In late 2012 and early 2013, protests and vigils took place across the country, but soon other issues overtook demands for women’s safety. ”In the wake of the Nirbhaya case [the 2012 rape] the nation was in fervor  —   taking to the streets, debating on various media outlets,” the organizers of the #IWillGoOut march told me in a collectively authored email. ”Some blamed her and her partner. Some fathers vowed to never send their daughters out again because the world was cruel to them. Is this how we deal with assault? By limiting the freedoms and mobility of half the population?” What’s more, cases of sexual attack are on the rise. Data shows that police reports of assault on women rose 92 percent from 42, 968 in 2011 to 82, 422 in 2015. But conviction rates declined by 5 percent. In Karnataka, the rate of conviction is 1. 2 percent. Sukriti Gupta,   at the Academy For Earth Sustainability, an environment education organization, said she’s still hopeful of making a difference. ”I strongly believe reclaiming public space, making our voices heard, is important to remind and encourage others, especially women, that there is a support system out there  —   that we have a right and a place in our country, at night, regardless of what we wear.” Plus, she said, ”the visual nature of marches can cross socioeconomic barriers and provide food for thought for those who are normally not engaged in   press such as women and young girls living in more conservative families and slum areas.” The organizers of the march told me that the Bangalore harassment was not an isolated incident: ”It is a visible part of systemic inequality that prevents, hinders and shames half the population from moving around their cities, their homes. It is time to stake a claim in our landscape and our rights to own the streets and go out!” India’s tourism minister expressed the opposite perspective in August 2016. After high profile rape cases across the country, some involving foreign tourists, in August 2016 Mahesh Sharma advised foreign visitors to avoid wearing skirts and venturing out at night: ”For their own safety, women foreign tourists should not wear short dresses and skirts,” he said, because ”Indian culture is different from the Western.” This attitude toward safety seems to have been a contentious issue even a century ago. The Twitter account for the Why Loiter group has shared a quote from 1905 that mocks how keeping women safe means locking them up rather than changing or punishing the attitudes that endanger them."
"Maintaining a   relationship can be difficult, but Romy Madley Croft, Oliver Sim and Jamie Smith have managed to do it  —   and they’ve become megastars in the process. They make up the band The xx, and they’ve been making music together since they were kids. The band’s two singers, Croft and Sim, met in preschool in a London suburb when they were only 3 years old. ”They had music classes, and I remember sharing a xylophone in that music class,” Sim says. ”I’ve also got pictures of it, so I’m sure I’m building memories off a picture.” Croft says another old photo of the two of them sticks out to her. ”There’s one of us standing on a bench as if we’re sort of on a stage. Oliver’s on the side that he stands on [when we perform] and I’m on the side that I stand on, which is quite a beautiful coincidence, I think,” Croft says. Their friendship with the third member of The xx, producer Jamie Smith, began a bit later, when the trio was 11 years old. The three formed a   and insular crew. ”I was starting out a new school, and Romy and Oliver had come to a new school as well,” Smith says. ”There were only a few people there that I liked, so I was quite happy just to stay us. I think just keeping your closest friends around is the best.” The trio released its debut album, xx, in 2009, and has sold millions of records since then. All three bandmates have grown in different ways: Smith released a solo album under the name Jamie xx Sim gave up drinking Croft got engaged. Now, the group has a new album called I See You coming out Jan. 13. Croft says one song on the new record, called ”Test Me,” touches on the challenges of close friendships. She says the lyrics describe ”a sort of hard time in our friendship, between Oliver and I  —   and a time when all three of us were quite distant from each other emotionally and geographically.” But Croft says those challenges led to some important changes. ”It sort of represents a new time of us actually talking about things rather than just pushing them down, and I think that was a good thing,” Croft says. ”Sometimes we would say things to each other in the music before we could say it to each other.” Croft, Sim and Smith shared these and other stories with NPR’s Ari Shapiro.

"On a bright Sunday afternoon last November, Anastasia Popova was picketing outside the Russian Embassy in Washington with a dozen other activists. ”Russia will be free! Russia will be free!” they chanted at the hulking white building on the other side of the street. The forlorn group of protesters held up signs calling for the release of a jailed Russian activist, Ildar Dadin, and displayed photographs of other people they called political prisoners in their home country. Under somewhat different circumstances, Popova, 29, might have been sitting inside the embassy looking out. She aspired to become a diplomat, but after getting involved in opposition politics in Russia, she had to make a choice. ”They told me: ’You can’t work for the government in the daytime and prepare protests against that government in the evening,’” Popova said. She chose politics  —   and joined the staff of Ilya Ponomaryov, one of the lone opposition voices in the Russian parliament. A time of uncertainty  Five years ago, Russia was in upheaval. Vladimir Putin’s decision to run for an unprecedented third term as Russia’s president was fueling street protests in Moscow and other cities. Politicians like Ponomaryov saw a potential opening to begin liberalizing Russia’s tightly controlled political system. Hopes for a thaw were soon dashed. Putin, who had been president from 2000 to 2008, and prime minister from 2008 to 2012, won the presidential election in March 2012. Many protest leaders found themselves facing lawsuits and jail time. In 2014, Ponomaryov was the only member of parliament to vote against annexing Crimea, which Russia had just seized from Ukraine. Russian authorities then started building a criminal case against him. Ponomaryov moved to the United States, and before long, Popova says she got a warning that she, too, should leave the country  —   immediately. ”That was the end of October 2014. And that was my personal Halloween, you know, when I found myself in the U. S. with just a suitcase, and I had no idea where to go next,” she said. A long tradition, Popova follows in a long history of Russian political exiles dating back to the 1800s. In the past century, there have been spurts of immigration from Russia to the U. S.: Jews escaping persecution, Russian aristocrats fleeing revolutionaries, and dissidents getting the boot from the communist regime. Russian applications for political asylum in the U. S. have increased for the fourth straight year, according to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Radio Free Europe. In the last fiscal year, 1, 912 Russians applied for asylum, the highest level in more than two decades. Exiles granted asylum may be safe from persecution abroad. But they’re also cut off from their homeland. ”Once they’re out, it’s actually quite difficult for them to have an influence back again,” said Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ”They run the risk of harming contacts, even family members, if they engage in overt political activity that in some way is involving organization of protest movements still in Russia itself.” Hill said that the Internet affords little help to effect change at home. ”I think social media does add a different ingredient, but what it creates is a sort of a parallel alternative community,” she said. ”It doesn’t necessarily translate to action on the ground.” Remaining in Russia, Someone who’s still trying to take action inside Russia is Ilya Yashin, an opposition leader refusing to leave. In late October he visited the U. S. to build bridges to members of Russia’s   diaspora. ”Sure, I agree, the risks are high. And from a certain point of view it probably is crazy to oppose Putin inside Russia. But somebody has to do it,” Yashin said in an interview in an Alexandria, Va. coffee shop. ”The Putin regime is happy to get rid of its opponents and does everything it can so that we leave,” Yashin said. ”That’s the reason I see my mission to do everything so that Putin’s critics stay in Russia. That’s why I haven’t left.” Yashin said many political activists left Russia after his friend, opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, was assassinated outside the Kremlin in February 2015. As for Popova, she said exile was her only option. ”I believe that being in the U. S. and telling the U. S. government the truth about the political situation in Russia is more useful than just being tortured in jail,” she said. When it comes to dealing with Russia in the future, Popova had a message for   Donald Trump: Negotiate hard, don’t make any concessions as a sign of good will, and keep expectations low."
"The official Electoral College vote tally just concluded, but some Democratic House members decided to put on a bit of a show. More than half a dozen members rose at different points to object to the results of the election, citing Russian hacking, the legitimacy of the election and electors, voting machines, voter suppression and more. Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts was the first to rise. Amid grumbling from other members, Vice President Biden, who presided in his role as president of the Senate, gaveled the body to order. He noted that any objection must be in writing, signed by a member of the House and a member of the Senate. He asked McGovern if he had fulfilled all three. McGovern admitted the objection was not signed by a member of the Senate, and Biden threw it out. ”In that case the objection cannot be entertained,” Biden said, and Republicans stood and cheered. Jamie Raskin of Maryland interrupted later. Biden cut him off, read the requirements again and asked if his objection was signed by a member of the Senate. Raskin, too, admitted it was not. This went on with others. Biden grew increasingly curt. At times, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan could be seen laughing behind him. ”It is over,” Biden chided. Three protesters were escorted out of the House chamber. NPR’s Susan Davis reports that at least one was arrested. NPR’s Ron Elving notes that it all was a similar scene to one that played out in January 2001 after George W. Bush’s election, the Florida recount and the Supreme Court decision that stopped it. The vice president, who had to play Biden’s role then, was none other than Al Gore himself. The objectors were all from the House, many from Florida. After overruling several objectors the same way Biden did, Gore jokingly noted that it was becoming somewhat painful. ”This is going to sound familiar to you,” he noted, ” —  to all of us. ...”"
"A golden statue commemorating the plight of ”comfort women”  —   a euphemism for the Korean women and girls forced by the Japanese to work as sex slaves in   brothels during World War II  —   has caused a diplomatic row between Japan and South Korea. At the end of December, activists placed the golden statue of a young woman sitting in a chair in front of the Japanese Consulate in the southern city of Busan, South Korea. Local authorities initially removed the statue, citing a lack of permits, The Korea Herald reported. But after public outcry, authorities allowed the statue to be replaced and the district mayor held a press conference to apologize. Now, Japan is taking countermeasures. Speaking at a news conference Friday, Japan’s chief Cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, announced that the country is withdrawing both its ambassador to South Korea and the consul general at Busan. Suga also said Japan is pulling out of some   economic talks, according to state broadcaster NHK. Calling the situation ”extremely regrettable,” Suga said the statue is a break with the landmark deal in 2015 between the two countries over comfort women. That deal was billed ”final and irreversible,” ostensibly smoothing over the persistent source of strain between the two countries, as we reported. It ”included an apology from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and a billion yen (roughly $8. 3 million) fund to support the 46 surviving Korean women.” But some activists spoke out against the deal, as the BBC reported: ”Critics say it was reached without consultation with victims, did not contain Japan’s acknowledgement of legal responsibility, and did not provide direct compensation to the victims.” Suga also accused South Korea of violating ”the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which requires host countries to protect diplomatic missions from the impairment of their dignity,” NHK reported. Korea’s finance ministry said it ”regrets” that Japan suspended economic talks, including those focused on a potential currency swap deal, the Korea Herald reported. ”It is desirable that the two countries continue bilateral economic and financial cooperation regardless of political and diplomatic relations,” the ministry added. The Associated Press reported that another statue by the same artist has stood in front of Japan’s embassy in Seoul since 2011, prior to the agreement. And the BBC says that ”another 37 are thought to exist in South Korea, while in Australia a similar statue has sparked a row between Korean and Japanese community groups.”"
"  Donald Trump has promised to step back from his business interests when he takes office. He says he’ll let his two adult sons take the helm and that he won’t make any new deals while he’s president. While he’s unwinding some of his roughly 500 business deals involving about 20 countries as Inauguration Day approaches, many others are moving forward, causing concern about conflicts of interest. Most of the projects are licensing deals, says Joshua Kurlantzick, a Southeast Asia specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”They pay Trump a fee and someone builds the resorts and they slap his name on it,” he says. ”So it’s not like he’s got his own skin in the game or he’s possibly going to be involved in shaping the resorts.” Still, Kurlantzick and others say any involvement by Trump in a project, even if it’s just his name, can create a conflict of interest  —   complicating any national security, foreign policy or economic concerns the U. S. has with a particular country. For example, in a $150 million project in Manila, Trump had received up to $5 million for the use of his name. This is in a country where human rights concerns have been raised as a result of President Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal   campaign. More than 6, 000 people have been killed since Duterte took office in June. Robert Manning, a former National Intelligence Council official now with the Atlantic Council, says Trump has been reluctant to criticize Duterte’s human rights policies. ”Whether his business interests are a factor in that, I don’t know how you ascertain that. I think it would certainly give [Trump] a motivation,” he says. To further complicate things, Duterte recently named Trump’s main business partner in the $150 million Manila Trump Tower deal, Jose E. B. Antonio, as the Philippines special envoy to the U. S. on trade and economic policy. Manning says it won’t be illegal for Trump to interact with Antonio in his capacity as trade representative. ”It’s the sticky question of deciding where national interests stop and business begins, and vice versa,” Manning says. Trump has promised to keep his hands off his business empire while president. But Kurlantzick says Trump’s sons will have to build up strong relations with powerful people to help keep overseas projects moving. And this could be problematic. Kurlantzick cites an example in Indonesia, where the Trump Organization is involved in two resort projects. One of Trump’s Indonesian contacts was Setya Novanto, the speaker of the House of Representatives. He had to step down in December 2015 after being accused of corruption. ”He briefly gave up his post, which was like the equivalent of [House Speaker] Paul Ryan, last year, because he was caught on an audio trying to get a $4 billion payment from an American mining company,” Kurlantzick explains. In September 2015, during the presidential campaign, Novanto went to New York to meet with Trump  —   and accompanied him at a news conference, where Trump praised him as ”an amazing man” and a ”great man.” Stephen Gillers, an ethics professor at New York University Law School, says Trump needs to be careful not to erode public confidence. ”What we want to make sure of is that the deal our president cuts is solely for the benefit of the United States, that there’s no other interest that could be affecting his judgement, and that includes his own financial interests,” he says. The only way for Trump to do that, Gillers says, is to divest himself from all his business interests when he becomes president."
"  Donald Trump is nominating Jay Clayton, a Wall Street lawyer, to be the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some who know him say Clayton is a good man for the job, but critics say his ties to big financial firms create too many conflicts of interest. The big question is whether Trump has chosen a fox to guard the henhouse. Clayton works as a lawyer for a firm that has represented Goldman Sachs for decades. He also represented Ally Financial and other financial firms when they struck settlements related to wrongdoing in the subprime mortgage scandal. And Clayton’s wife currently works for Goldman Sachs. ”I do think that having a chairman of the SEC whose spouse works at Goldman Sachs or another large investment bank is a serious problem,” says Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and the former chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush. Painter says Goldman and other big banks had their business models severely restricted by the   Wall Street Reform Act, and there is already pressure building to scale back that law during the Trump administration. ”The decision about whether to repeal   or how to enforce   and rulemaking under    —   all those decisions will have an enormous impact on Goldman Sachs,” Painter says. ”And to have Goldman Sachs have a controlling influence over the career of the SEC chairman’s spouse, I think could be an untenable situation.” Still, Painter says he is withholding judgement until he watches the nomination hearing process. Maybe there’s a way to resolve that and other conflicts. And he says just because Clayton is a Wall Street insider, that doesn’t mean he’d be a bad SEC chairman. ”There are plenty of good Wall Street people who could actually aggressively regulate Wall Street. They know where the bodies are buried they know where the reforms are necessary,” Painter says. So, is Clayton that kind of Wall Street insider  —   or the kind that would be soft on enforcement? ”What I understand about him is that he’s a very, very capable lawyer, very knowledgeable, practical and very ” says Bill McLucas, who was head of enforcement for the SEC under the administrations of George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton. And, McLucas says, if Clayton makes it through the congressional hearing and vetting process, if past SEC chairs are any guide, ”once they are confirmed it is rare that the public interest is not their guiding principle.” Still, there are plenty of skeptics. Former Rep. Barney Frank says he sees more of the same here  —   a series of nominations by Trump of people who are too beholden to Wall Street. ”It is one more example of the biggest    I believe, in American history  —   namely Trump winning by claiming he was going to stand up to Wall Street and be tough and then becoming the best friend Wall Street and the opponents of regulation have ever had,” Frank says. Frank says the   law that bears his name gave the SEC strong powers to protect the financial system as well as everyday Americans who are buying stocks or buying their first home. But, he says, ”You cannot make laws that are  .” Frank says he’s worried that even if Republicans don’t have the votes ultimately to repeal laws such as   the appointments Trump is trying to make could still severely weaken regulation. And, Frank says, that could make the financial system and everyday Americans less protected from wrongdoing."
"Tilikum, possibly the most famous orca in the world, has died, according to SeaWorld Orlando. He was the subject of the influential documentary Blackfish, and outcry over his story prompted SeaWorld to stop breeding orcas in captivity. Tilikum was estimated to be 36 years old, SeaWorld said in a statement, which is old for a captive killer whale. He faced ”very serious health issues,” the park says, and had been declining for months. The orca died Friday morning surrounded by trainers and veterinary staff. A necropsy is required to determine the official cause of death, but he had suffered a ”persistent and complicated bacterial lung infection,” the park says, which had been treated by a range of medicines and therapies. Tilikum was 22 feet long and weighed more than 11, 000 pounds, according to The Associated Press. He was born off the waters of Iceland, captured and performed in captivity for decades  —   first at the   Sealand of the Pacific and then at SeaWorld Orlando. A prolific breeder, he sired more than 20 calves. But he became notorious for aggressive behavior. In the ’90s, he was implicated in two deaths: a trainer who drowned and a man who was found dead in his tank. Then, in 2010, he killed SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau, holding her underwater until she died of drowning and blunt force trauma. In the immediate aftermath of that incident, the question was whether Tilikum would be put down, and whether he would return to performing, as he did in 2011. But then a 2013 documentary called Blackfish changed the narrative around aggressive behavior by orcas, and by Tilikum in particular. In the film, former trainers at SeaWorld criticized the park’s practices as harmful for orcas and dangerous for trainers. They argued that animals such as Tilikum behaved aggressively because of the stress and trauma of captivity. As NPR’s Greg Allen reports, animal welfare groups have long protested against marine parks holding killer whales in captivity at all. When Blackfish came out  —   and aired on CNN, where it reached millions of viewers  —   the public joined in the outcry. The park has denied allegations that it mistreated orcas, but it did shift its position on captive breeding. Greg reports: ”Orcas are an intelligent, social species that spend much of their life in family groups and in the wild range over thousands of miles. Advocates say holding these huge mammals in a tank is cruel. . .. ”Activists stepped up their campaign against SeaWorld following the release of Blackfish. Attendance dropped at the park, a decline the company attributed in part to public reaction to the film. In response, SeaWorld’s new CEO Joel Manby announced the company was ending its orca breeding program  —   making this the last generation of killer whales at its parks. . .. Following SeaWorld’s decision to end its orca breeding program, [Jeffrey] Ventre and three other former SeaWorld trainers issued a statement. ’We’d like to send love to Tilikum,’ they wrote. ’In the end, his message was heard.’ ” Members of the public and former SeaWorld trainers also called for Tilikum to be released back into the wild, but SeaWorld says its captive orcas could not survive in the open sea. Tim Zimmerman, who wrote about Brancheau’s death in Outside magazine and was a producer on Blackfish, told Greg there was a deep well of public sympathy for Tilikum. ”I think that’s the most amazing thing that comes out of Tilikum’s story,” he said. ”He killed three human beings. And yet when you learn about his life story, he does become the victim and you do sympathize with him.”"
"Officials in the West African nation of Ivory Coast say soldiers have overrun police stations and seized the country’s   city, Bouake. It has been six years since the West African nation emerged from a civil war, during which Bouake was the headquarters of the rebellion. NPR’s Ofeibea   said there were also reports of gunfire in two other cities, Daloa and Korhogo, and that it wasn’t clear whether the attacks were a mutiny by current or former troops. As Ofeibea reported for NPR’s Newscast unit: ”Troops reportedly seized weapons from police stations and took up positions at the entrance to Bouake. One soldier says former fighters integrated into Ivory Coast’s army were demanding bonuses of $8, 000 apiece  —   plus a house. . .. ”A statement from Ivorian Defense Minister   Donwahi has called on soldiers to remain calm and return to their barracks, to allow, he says, for lasting solutions to the latest crisis in Ivory Coast, which has recently been burnishing its democratic credentials.” A member of the national assembly representing Bouake, Bema Fofana, told the BBC that ”the soldiers did not appear to have a leader or spokesman, making it difficult to negotiate with them,” the broadcaster reported, and that ”most of the soldiers were former rebels who were integrated into the army after the civil war.” The BBC also reported that a resident who asked not to be identified said soldiers armed with automatic rifles ”fired at the offices of the state broadcaster in the city.” ”They are heavily armed and parading through the city of Daloa,” a student named Karim Sanogo told The Associated Press. ”Security forces have abandoned their posts. Everyone has returned home to seek shelter.” Earlier this year, a terrorist attack in a tourist city on the country’s coast threatened the fragile peace sought after the civil war. In March, militants from   in the Islamic Maghreb killed more than a dozen people at beach hotels, as we reported. ”This country, once an oasis of peace, security, stability and prosperity, is emerging from a devastating decade of political violence and a civil war,” Ofeibea reported at the time. ”The economy was on the rebound.”"
"An overwhelming majority of people disapprove of Republican lawmakers’ plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act without having a ready replacement for the health care law, according to a poll released Friday. And judging by the   and lobbying in the first week of the new congressional session, many health care and business groups agree. A poll released Friday by the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that 75 percent of Americans say they either want lawmakers to leave Obamacare alone, or repeal it only when they can replace it with a new health care law. Twenty percent of those polled say they want to see the law killed immediately. But Drew Altman, CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation, says the poll shows lawmakers don’t have a strong mandate to repeal Obamacare. ”Most of the American people said they’re either against repealing it or they’re against repealing it unless Republicans put a replacement plan on the table,” Altman says. ”They want to see what comes next before they seen the ACA repealed.” Americans are about equally divided over whether Congress should repeal Obamacare, the poll shows. But of the 48 percent who want the law rolled back, about 60 percent want lawmakers to wait until they have an alternative plan. And Obamacare isn’t even people’s top health care concern. The vast majority  —   67 percent  —   say their top priority is finding a way to lower their health care costs. The poll findings come just days after Republicans in the Senate took the first step toward repealing President Obama’s signature health care law. They voted on Wednesday to move ahead with a budget resolution that will allow them to take funding away from Obamacare, which will effectively gut the law because the subsidies to buy insurance, and the penalties for not doing so, will disappear. Republicans say they intend to vote on repeal, but give the law time to sunset while they come up with a replacement that will give the millions of people covered under Obamacare access to insurance through some other vehicle. On Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan,  . said the replacement legislation would pass by the end of the year. But doctors, hospital groups, insurers and analysts are skeptical of that strategy. In letters, press releases and advertising campaigns, many organizations have made it clear that they want to see a replacement for the Affordable Care Act in place, or at least outlined, before Congress repeals the current law. A report released Dec. 6 by the American Hospital Association and Federation of American Hospitals warned that a repeal could cost hospitals hundreds of billions and said ”any reconsideration of the ACA should be accompanied at the same time by provisions that guarantee similar coverage to those who would lose it.” A letter sent Tuesday from the American Medical Association urged lawmakers to release details of their Obamacare replacement before repealing the current law. ”Patients and other stakeholders should be able to clearly compare current policy to new proposals so they can make informed decisions about whether it represents a step forward in the ongoing process of health reform,” the letter said. Dr. Andrew Gurman, president of the American Medical Association, says people should be able to evaluate the proposed Obamacare replacement before the current law is thrown out. ”People in this country need to understand what it is they’re being asked to substitute for what’s there now so they can have an informed opinion about whether it’s better or not,” Gurman says. And repeal and delay? ”We have a concern that that creates uncertainty in insurance markets and uncertainty in people about whether they’re going to have continuity of coverage,” Gurman adds. He says he and his members talk with lawmakers regularly. A separate study released Thursday projects that a straight repeal of the law could kill 3 million jobs across the country by 2021. That study, by the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, finds that about a third of those lost jobs would come from health care, and the rest would be in other industries such as retail, construction, finance and insurance. Total business output could be cut by as much as $2. 6 billion over four years, the report says. California, Florida and Texas would be most affected. Leighton Ku, the report’s lead author, says the debate over ACA repeal has focused almost completely on insurance coverage and has ignored the broader economic impact. ”The payments you make to health care then become income for workers and income for other businesses. And this spreads out,” Ku says. ”Health care is almost a fifth of the US economy, so as you begin to change health care, there are repercussions that go across all sectors.” Ku says he can’t estimate what economic impact Obamcare replacement would have because Republicans have yet to lay out their plans. ”It’s a mystery,” he says.

"The Justice Department is issuing new guidance to federal agents on how to secure eyewitness identifications, an initiative designed to reflect decades of scientific research and bolster public confidence in the criminal justice system, NPR has learned. The policy has two major components: It directs U. S. investigators to document or record an eyewitness’s confidence in an identification at the very moment the ID is made, and it encourages federal agents to conduct ”blind” or ”blinded” photo arrays of suspects in which the agent leading the session doesn’t know which photo represents the prime suspect. ”We view this as an important step in doing everything we can to ensure the greatest reliability possible for the evidence we’re using at trial,” Deputy U. S. Attorney General Sally Yates said. Yates said the department based its guidance on research that supports the idea ”of just how important it is to get as much detail as possible about just how sure that witness is that this is the guy” long before any trial or court proceeding begins. Authorities also are leery of the idea that a person leading a photo array could, intentionally or not, provide cues to an eyewitness about whom they should select out of a photo lineup. Such practices have been blamed for encouraging faulty eyewitness identifications and contributing to the problem of wrongful convictions. That’s why DOJ is urging law enforcement to conduct   blind photo displays. ”If you don’t know, it’s virtually impossible verbally or nonverbally . .. to potentially be able to cue the witness,” Yates said. The guidance from Yates marks the first departmentwide policy for DOJ agencies, and it applies to such law enforcement components as the FBI, DEA, ATF and the U. S. Marshals Service. ”This DOJ memo reflects a series of best practices recommended by scientists based on research conducted over the past,” said Brandon Garrett, a law professor at the University of Virginia and author of a book about wrongful convictions. ”It adopts the recommendations of the 2014 National Academy of Sciences report. And it sends an important message that accuracy matters in criminal cases.” Garrett added that the procedures for lineups ”are well designed to be practical and to apply in many different types of criminal cases where eyewitnesses are important.” You can read the guidelines here."
"In the kitchen at Oakland Avenue Urban Farm, just north of downtown Detroit, Linda Carter and Shawnetta Hudson are in the final stages of making their newest jam creation:   preserves. Carter is meticulously wiping down tables while Hudson seals the lids on jars. Then comes the logo  —   a beautiful graphic of a black woman with afro hair made of strawberries. The kitchen is small and basic, but for the past year it has served as the hub of a   product called Afro Jam. ”The name Afro Jam and the logo are empowering, independent and strong,” Carter says. ”That’s what we want our community to be.” Carter, the food safety manager at the farm, recruited Hudson from the local community to help her keep up with making and selling the product. Strawberry, peach and blueberry are Afro Jam’s best sellers. ”Strawberry jam, that’s my thing,” says Hudson. ”And when Linda and I work together, we’re on point at all times.” Staying ”on point” is a goal of Carter’s. The jam venture has to be profitable. So in the past year the small group of about a   women, rotating volunteers and three paid employees has made an aggressive push to sell the spreads at summer festivals and farmers markets.   is a product of One Mile, a neighborhood arts and culture organization, and Oakland Avenue Urban Farm, a nonprofit dedicated to cultivating healthy local food sources for the surrounding community. The farm is a project of Northend Christian Community Development Corporation  —   both are managed by Jerry Hebron. It has a vegetable garden and an apple orchard. Hebron also oversees a weekly farmers market in the summer. Roughly 83 percent of Detroit’s population is black, an aftereffect of white flight that began in the 1950s. As the people left Detroit, so did the supermarkets  —   especially in poorer, blacker neighborhoods. Fresh fruits and vegetables became much harder to come by for many city residents. As a result, gardens started popping up in Detroit, which currently has roughly 1, 500 urban farms. Some are large and operate at an industrial scale others are single lots that have been turned into vegetable gardens for a few families. The idea for Afro Jam was born out of a need to generate revenue year round while also keeping the community involved, says Hebron. ”The community is at the root of everything we do,” she says. So Hebron began spreading the word at the farmers market: They wanted to start a new line of jams using old family recipes. Recipes for making preserves poured in  —   including some that had been handed down for generations. Constance King, 67, heard the call and was excited to share her mother’s recipe with the folks from Afro Jam. ”My mother brought her jam recipe [from the South] with her  —   it belonged to her mother and to her mother’s mother,” King says. ”I felt proud about being able to share that recipe. It’s a beautiful way of keeping my mother alive.” A lifelong resident of Detroit, King loves the city’s rich   history. Making biscuits and jam, she says, was part of the Southern black experience  —   they’ve been a staple at the Southern supper table since at least the   century. ”This [growing fruits and vegetables] is a good idea, it’s something we can do with all of this empty land,” King says. ”Our neighborhood used to be full of families  —   there was not a vacant block. There were hardware stores, delis and grocery stores. It was a   community.” King’s family is originally from Georgia but moved to Detroit in the 1940s during the Great Migration, when millions of   left their homes in the rural South in search of better jobs and an escape from harsh segregationist laws. Hebron says that among black Detroiters, the tradition of making homemade jams has largely fallen by the wayside in the modern era. Oakland Avenue Urban Farms used heritage recipes from seven different families  —   unearthing them from hiding places in attics and   recipe boxes. In the fall of 2015, the ladies of the farm set out to make their first batch of jam. Some of the recipes they received took days to make and weren’t practical for production. Carter and Hebron settled on strawberry jam as their first batch, which took several days and four people to make. ”We bonded over making jam, laughing and sharing old family stories,” Hebron says. ”Gathering is what it’s all about,” Carter says. ”There is nothing greater than bringing people together over food.” Proceeds from the jam venture go to Northend Christian CDC, a nonprofit that’s aimed at revitalizing Detroit’s North End historic district, where One Mile and Oakland Avenue Urban Farm are based. For Hebron, Carter and the rest of the women who make Afro Jam, this is a way to preserve the legacy of Detroit’s black families. ”It’s one of the most amazing projects I’ve ever worked on,” Hebron says. Martina Guzman is a journalist based in Detroit. She’s currently the race and justice journalism fellow at the Damon J. Keith Center for Civil Rights at Wayne State University."
"Talladega College isn’t known for its football team  —   because it doesn’t have one. But it does have a band  —   the   Marching Tornadoes. It is the pride of the campus in this small town about 50 miles east of Birmingham. The Presidential Inaugural Committee included Talladega’s band on its list of participants in the traditional inauguration day parade. But the invitation to Washington, D. C. stirred angst for some  —   because of   Donald Trump’s divisive campaign rhetoric. Talladega was founded by former slaves 150 years ago and was the first college in Alabama to accept   students. A debate erupted on campus and around the nation as to whether Talladega should go. Yesterday, college president Billy Hawkins announced the Marching Tornadoes will participate. Band member Darrious Hayes agreed with the decision. He’s been in the band since 2014, his freshman year, and sees the trip to the inauguration as an opportunity. He says this will be his first visit to the nation’s capital. ”The alumni don’t want us to go because of Trump,” says Hayes. ”But we’re saying it’s not because of Donald Trump. It’s because of the experience.” Participation in this inauguration is not popular for some Talladega alums like Shirley Ferrill, a 1974 graduate. She says what Trump said on the campaign trail is not consistent with the values of Talladega College. ”To have them take part in anything that smacks of support for Donald Trump makes me sick,” says Ferrill, Some members of other groups like the Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir have had similar concerns about performing in the inauguration. For Ferrill, this issue is bound up with Talladega’s history. ”I do care what others think about the college’s participation,” she says. ”I care about the reputation Talladega has established over 150 years and I think that reputation would be damaged by the college participating.” Ferrill launched an online petition calling for Talladega to decline the invitation. More than 1, 600 people signed it. No college administrators would answer questions about the decision to go. A Talladega spokeswoman did say it’s a good opportunity for students. The Talladega Marching Tornadoes played at an NFL game in New Orleans last year. But this performance at the 58th Presidential Inauguration will be its biggest ever."
"Starting next week, Norway will become the first country to switch off its nationwide FM radio network and convert completely to digital signals. The change was announced in 2015, and will take months to be fully implemented. The Norwegian government decided to make the transition in part because digital radio can provide many more channels for the same price  —   eight times as many, to be precise. Norway currently has room for just five national radio stations on its FM system  —   three public broadcasting channels, and two commercial channels. Other national radio stations, as well as some regional and local stations, are already using the digital system. Supporters of the switch also say digital radio will sound clearer than FM, or frequency modulation, and that the signal will be clearer in places where fjords and mountains interfere with FM signals. As we reported in 2015, the Norwegian government also says that digital radio is less likely to fail in extreme conditions, which lawmakers saw as an advantage for emergency preparedness. The CEO of Digitalradio Norway says the country’s FM network is antiquated and would need massive investments to maintain  —   so, to allow investment in digital radio, the FM network needs to be shut down. But NPR’s Frank Langfitt reports that the public in general isn’t happy about the decision to abandon FM entirely. ”A recent poll shows that   of Norwegians are against ditching FM,” he reports. ”Among the concerns: people may miss warnings for emergencies that are broadcast on FM. ”In addition, two million cars in Norway  —   a country of just five million people  —   don’t have digital audio broadcasting receivers. ”A digital adapter for an FM car radio costs about $170.” Reuters reports that the shutdown of FM signals will begin in the northern city of Bodø on Jan. 11, and extend across the country by the end of the year. Some local stations, however, will continue to transmit over FM signals until 2022, The Local reports. Norway’s transition to an   radio will be closely watched by other countries considering the same move. ”Among other nations, the U. K. plans to review the need for a switchover once digital listening reaches 50 per cent,” the CBC reports. ”That could be reached by the end of 2017 on current trends, Digital Radio U. K. spokeswoman Yvette Dore said.”"
"When Kayla Wilson was 15, her mom  —   Wendy Founds  —   was in prison serving a   term for felony drug charges. When Founds was 15 she started using drugs, and at some point became addicted to methamphetamines. ”When I asked Mom how she got started she told me that after her   died she was just mad at the world and mad at God, and that’s when she told one of her   that she wanted to get high,” Kayla said during a 2006 visit to StoryCorps with her grandmother, Teri Lyn  . When Founds got busted, she was at home, Kayla explained. ”And I think they were making dope and it had spilled on my younger sister. And it was just so heartbreaking to understand that this is what’s going on and this is how it’s going to be. When I saw her in prison it was horrible because you see her come out of the door in that white suit. And her hair was gone. And she loved her long hair and I just had to cry. And then having to say bye and holding onto her knowing you couldn’t take her with you was the most horrible experience I’ve ever had.” Back then, Kayla hoped that when her mom got out of prison, she would get to be a child for a change. ”Not have to worry about being the mature responsible adult,” she said. ”I think that it’ll really be nice.” Founds was released from prison in 2008. Ten years after Kayla’s StoryCorps visit,    Founds joined her daughter at StoryCorps to talk about the past. Like what she remembers about the day she got out of prison. ”I remember how you smelled, it was vanilla,” Founds said. ”And I remember the relief of, our lives get to really start from this point forward.” Kayla, now 25 and a high school teacher, remembers her mom’s apology. ”I think that was a defining moment for us, because I got to tell you what I’d always wanted to tell you which was that, you know, you can never make up for that time,” she said. Founds cried for days after that conversation, but says what she heard helped her become a better mom. Kayla also admitted wishing her mom was different back in those days. ”I can remember, you know, writing in diaries about how much I hated you because you chose drugs over me,” she said. But in the end, she forgave her mom. ”When you finally decided to get clean, it was obvious you were sincere,” she said. ”And you’re my mom, and as my mom, I loved you. I wanted that relationship. ”Sure would have been great to have [it] growing up, but I’m happy you’re here and I’m happy we’re where we’re at today,” Kayla continued. ”And I think what we’ve got is awesome considering where we’ve been. So I’m excited to see what happens next.” Founds, who lives with Kayla, helps counsel other parents struggling with addiction. She was granted a pardon by Gov. Asa Hutchinson for her felony convictions on March 4, 2016. Audio produced for Morning Edition by John White and Madison Mullen.

"The final chapter of the Obama economy drew that much closer to its end on Friday, with the final jobs report of the 44th president’s time in office. That report showed the 75th straight month of job growth, with employers adding 156, 000 jobs. Solid, but nothing flashy. In that way, it was emblematic of how the job market has generally fared since the worst of the Great Recession’s aftermath: chugging along, slowly but surely recovering. With the final Obama administration jobs day in the books, it’s a good time to look at how American workers have fared. Donald Trump will inherit a job market that is vastly rehabilitated from devastating lows just a few years ago. However, it has also undergone profound changes that have scarred many American workers. Unemployment: How low can it go? As Obama prepares to leave office, the unemployment rate is at 4. 7 percent, less than half of the peak it reached in October 2009. That decline is the result of a prolonged period of job growth. The administration has grown fond of showing off its prolonged run of job growth every month. For some perspective, here’s how big that job growth was: Obama averaged 109, 000 jobs per month. That’s far better than either President Bush experienced, but it’s well below the 242, 000 that Bill Clinton presided over in the roaring 1990s. For Reagan, it was 166, 000. Of course, President Obama came into office as the economy was plunging into a recession (a plunge that also drags down George W. Bush’s number). But even if you average out Obama’s 75 straight months of job growth, you get 199, 000 jobs per month, still shy of Clinton’s economy. In other words, the Obama recovery has been moderate, but remarkably steady. The question is how long that steady climb can continue uninterrupted. The unemployment rate is already near a   low, as Steven Russolillo at the Wall Street Journal pointed out this week, and there is some question among economists how low it can go. Wages finally climbing, Having a job is one thing. Having a job that pays well is another. And slowly through Obama’s tenure, those wages have inched upward. In fact, wages were one bright spot of Friday’s jobs report. Average hourly wages were up by 2. 9 percent in December. After several years of hovering around 2 percent, that’s welcome growth. Aside from meaning more money in workers’ pockets, wage growth serves as yet another sign of a tightening labor market, signaling that employers are willing to pay more to attract workers. Rising wages may inspire the Federal Reserve to take its foot further off the gas pedal in the coming months (that is, allow interest rates to rise)  —   a reminder that the economy isn’t exactly under the president’s control. (More on this later.) Labor force participation is low, but what does it mean? This one became a flashpoint in the presidential election, with Trump at times pointing out how much the labor force shrank under Obama. The main measure of this is the labor force participation rate  —   that is, the percentage of people who are either working or looking for work (that is, who are in the labor force). That figure was at 65. 7 percent in January 2009, at the start of Obama’s presidency, and today is at 62. 7 percent  —   a steep drop. And today, the figure is well below its 2000 high of 67. 3 percent. But it’s not clear how bad or how benign that change is. Many Americans are out of the labor force and entirely happy about it. Quitting work to retire, for example, is a totally nonalarming reason to leave the labor force. But then, there may be many people who, facing a tough job market, have given up looking for work. That’s not good, and it also happened for many Americans both during and after the recession. In the aftermath of the recession, economists have tried to figure out exactly how many people are voluntarily versus involuntarily out of the labor force. As of 2014, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that half the decline in the participation rate at that time had come from ”  trends” like aging  —   as baby boomers age, that means a large chunk of the population will naturally retire. But that left half of the decline a result of economic weakness and a slow recovery, in the CBO’s estimation. Should the participation rate hold steady or creep upward during a Trump presidency, that could keep the unemployment rate from dropping, as only Americans who are looking for work are counted as ”unemployed.” That would be one of those cases where a slightly higher unemployment rate could be a good thing. Improvement for   workers,   job growth over the course of the Obama presidency has far outstripped   job growth, as FiveThirtyEight’s Ben Casselman has pointed out. Of course, some of those people working part time want to be working part time, and some don’t. Another bright spot here is that the share of those workers who are involuntarily part time has fallen off. However, that figure is still a fair bit higher than it was prior to the recession (and that level was itself, in turn, higher than it was before the prior recession). That’s one place where there could still be some improvement  —   there are still about 1 million more of those involuntary   workers than there were prior to the recession. An economy more about doing than making, Politicians of both parties love to talk about manufacturing. Obama pushed manufacturing initiatives throughout his presidency, and Trump built much of his economic message during the campaign around singing the praises of America’s manufacturers. But when it comes to employment, the   share of the economy has continued to fall. Throughout the past few decades, the share of Americans who make things  —   people in manufacturing, mining, logging and construction  —   has fallen off, and that trend continued during the recent recession, finally flattening out toward the end. We present this chart over a longer time frame, which makes it a little bit of a cheat  —   this isn’t exactly a measure of Obama’s ”record on jobs.” Nor is it necessarily a measure of economic weakness in fact, manufacturing has, thanks to technological advances, maintained strong output while shedding workers. It’s a reminder that all the usual macroeconomic indicators (unemployment, wages, labor force participation, GDP) can quantify a lot of things in the economy, but you have to dig in to learn about the quality of that economy  —   what exactly is going on behind those numbers. This decline in   jobs doesn’t signal that the economy is getting worse or better  —   it’s just changing, in this case to become more focused on providing services, instead of goods. All of this is to say that Trump inherits a job market that is humming along comfortably, given how poor of shape it was in only recently. But it’s also an economy that has sharply moved away from manufacturing and other   industries  —   the very ones he pushed the most in the election. That change has hurt plenty of Americans, despite the job market’s improvement. Trump has tried to claim credit for several hundred   jobs here and there (credit that he doesn’t always deserve, as the Washington Post’s Philip Bump has reported) but bringing manufacturing employment back in a sizable way seems like a tall order for any president. Furthermore, alternative work  —   like driving an Uber or Lyft  —   continues to grow quickly as a share of the economy. That change could eventually require policy attention, as more workers take jobs that don’t come with benefits. But there’s another big caveat here. Presidents get lots of credit and blame for the economy’s performance, despite the fact that they don’t really have firm control over that performance. (If they did, why would recessions ever happen?) Yes, a president can push an economic agenda and in some cases push particular policies that end up having a sizable impact on the economy (see: the 2009 stimulus package, which undeniably had a positive impact). But they also need Congress to enact those policies. Not only that, but the Federal Reserve has its own set of controls  —   a set to which the president does not have access, despite some conspiracies of politically motivated Fed  . So, like Obama, whatever happens to the economy under Trump, he may not deserve whatever credit he may claim (and the same goes for whatever blame is thrown his way)."
"Updated at 5:30 p. m.  The Office of Government Ethics is raising alarm over the pace of confirmation hearings for   Donald Trump’s nominees, saying Saturday that they have yet to receive required financial disclosures for some picks set to come before Congress next week. In a letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,  . Y. and Sen. Elizabeth Warren,  . released Saturday, OGE Director Walter Shaub wrote that ”the announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me” and that the current schedule ”has created undue pressure on OGE’s staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews. ”More significantly, it has left some of the nominees with potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues shortly before their scheduled hearings,” Shaub continued. ”I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process.” Shaub explains in the letter that the Ethics in Government Act requires that presidential appointments confirmed by the Senate obtain OGE certification of their financial disclosures prior to any congressional hearings. Such a process is ”complex” and ”” he notes, and takes ”weeks, not days” to ensure that the Senate has a clear picture of any possible conflicts of interest. A Senate GOP source, however, noted that in the past the OGE paperwork hasn’t always preceded hearings. For example, in 2001, Rod Paige, George W. Bush’s nominee for Secretary of Education, had his hearing over a week before the committee received the OGE paperwork. Senate committees are set to begin confirmation for several Trump nominees for Cabinet positions and other posts next week so that they can be voted on and sworn in as soon as possible after Trump takes office on January 20. Democrats have already charged that Senate Republicans are trying to hurry through hearings for the  ’s Cabinet, and the warning letter from the federal ethics watchdog gives that argument more weight. Schumer said in a statement that the OGE letter ”makes crystal clear that the transition team’s collusion with Senate Republicans to jam through these Cabinet nominees before they’ve been thoroughly vetted is unprecedented.” ”The Senate and the American people deserve to know that these Cabinet nominees have a plan to avoid any conflicts of interest, that they’re working on behalf of the American people and not their own bottom line, and that they plan to fully comply with the law,” Schumer continued. ”Senate Republicans should heed the advice of this independent office and stop trying to jam through unvetted nominees.” In a statement, the Trump transition team dismissed the OGE letter as overtly political and argued that ”the transition process is currently running smoothly.” ”In the midst of a historic election where Americans voted to drain the swamp, it is disappointing some have chosen to politicize the process in order to distract from important issues facing our country,” the Trump statement read. ”This is a disservice to the country and is exactly why voters chose Donald J. Trump as their next president.” Shaub said that his office would ”continue expediting our ethics reviews of the  ’s nominees to meet reasonable timeframes without sacrificing quality.” ”It would, however, be cause for alarm if the Senate were to go forward with hearings on nominees whose reports OGE has not certified,” he continued. ”For as long as I remain Director, OGE’s staff and agency ethics officials will not succumb to pressure to cut corners and ignore conflicts of interest.” In November, Shaub raised eyebrows when the OGE Twitter account posted odd tweets urging Trump to fully divest from his business interests. NPR later reported that it was Shaub himself who had personally directed the tweets. Tamara Keith contributed. "
"Updated at 5:52 p. m. One day after five people were killed at an airport in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. more details are coming to light on the suspected gunman: Esteban Ruiz Santiago, a U. S. military veteran. The    was arrested by police shortly after the shooting began at the airport’s baggage claim area. He is now at a Broward County jail, where authorities say he is being held on suspicion of murder. Authorities say there is no indication that Santiago worked with anyone else in planning or executing the attack. Santiago, who served as a combat engineer in the National Guard in Puerto Rico and Alaska, was discharged from service last year for unsatisfactory performance. Santiago was reported for several infractions like AWOLs, or absences without leave. During Santiago’s time with the Puerto Rico National Guard, he was deployed to Iraq from April 2010 to February 2011. The U. S. pulled troops from the country at the end of that year. His aunt, Maria Ruiz Rivera, tells The Record of New Jersey that after he returned, she noticed changes in his mental health. ”He lost his mind,” Ruiz Rivera told the newspaper in Spanish. ”He said he saw things.” Over the course of 2016, Santiago was repeatedly reported to Anchorage police for physical disturbances, according to the city’s police chief, Christopher Tolley  —   including two separate reports of domestic violence and strangulation in October last year. The next month, Santiago walked into an FBI office in Anchorage ”to report that his mind was being controlled by a U. S. intelligence agency,” said FBI special agent Marlin Ritzman, at a Saturday press conference. Tolley described them as ”terroristic thoughts,” in which ”he believed he was being influenced by ISIS.” Ritzman offered more detail: ”During the interview, Mr. Santiago appeared agitated, incoherent and made disjointed statements. Although he stated he did not wish to harm anyone, as a result of his erratic behavior our agents contacted local authorities, who took custody of Mr. Santiago and transported him to the local medical facility for evaluation.” Shortly after that, Ritzman said, ”The FBI closed its assessment on Mr. Santiago after conducting database reviews and interagency checks.” Agents found no ties to terrorism in during their investigation. In the course of the encounter at the FBI office, Tolley says Santiago had left a firearm in his car, along with his newborn child. When Santiago was checked into the mental health facility, his weapon was ”logged into evidence for safekeeping.” That weapon was returned to Santiago in December. Authorities said that as of Saturday they cannot confirm whether it was the same firearm Santiago used in Friday’s attack. Santiago arrived at the Fort   International Airport on Friday afternoon, having traveled on a Delta flight from Anchorage, with a layover in Minneapolis. Jesse Davis, police chief at the Anchorage airport, says Santiago checked a   handgun with TSA according to proper protocol, without drawing attention to himself. Upon landing, he retrieved that handgun from baggage claim, loaded the weapon in the bathroom and then opened fire in Terminal 2 of the Fort Lauderdale airport, according to authorities. ”He just kind of continued coming in, just randomly shooting at people, no rhyme or reason to it,” one witness told MSNBC, saying Santiago ”went up and down the carousels of the baggage claim, shooting through luggage to get at people that were hiding.” Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel says it was approximately 70 to 80 seconds before a sheriff’s deputy confronted him. ”Indications are that he came here to carry out this horrific attack,” Piro said Saturday. ”We have not identified any triggers that would have caused this attack.” Piro added: ”It’s way too early for us to rule out anything.”"
"If you’ve never laid eyes on a dogfish  —   or tasted one  —   you’re not alone. Yep, it’s in the shark family. (See those telltale fins?) And fisherman Jamie Eldredge is now making a living catching dogfish off the shores of Cape Cod, Mass. When populations of cod  —   the Cape’s namesake fish  —   became too scarce, Eldredge wanted to keep fishing. That’s when he turned to dogfish  —   and it’s turned out to be a good option. The day I went out with him, Eldredge caught close to 6, 000 lbs. (Check out the video above.) ”It’s one of the most plentiful fish we have on the East Coast right now,” Brian Marder, owner of Marder Trawling Inc. told us. Fishermen in Chatham, Mass. caught about 6 million pounds of dogfish last year. So, who’s eating all this dogfish? Not Americans. ”99 percent of it” is shipped out, Marder says. The British use dogfish to make fish and chips. The French use it in stews and soups. Italians import it, too. The Europeans are eating it up. But Americans haven’t developed a taste for it. At least, not yet. The story of the dogfish is typical of the seafood swap. ”The majority of the seafood we catch in our U. S. fisheries doesn’t stay here,” explains Jennifer Dianto Kemmerly, who leads the Seafood Watch program at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. And while we export most of what is caught off U. S. shores, what do Americans eat? Imported fish. About ”90 percent of the seafood we consume in the U. S. is actually caught or   overseas,” Kemmerly says. To sustainable seafood advocates, this swap doesn’t make much sense. ”We’re kind of missing out on the bounty we actually have here,” Kemmerly says. And, it’s not just dogfish. The Environmental Defense Fund has launched a campaign called Eat These Fish to tell the story of a whole slew of plentiful fish caught off our shores. The group is trumpeting the conservation success of U. S. fisheries. Some species have been brought back from the brink of extinction through a system of quotas and collaboration between fishermen, conservationists and regulators. They point to fish such as Acadian Redfish and Pacific Ocean Perch. ”If people start to buy these fish more, we can really drive some more economic success to   fishermen,” says Tim Fitzgerald of the Environmental Defense Fund. Sustainable seafood advocates want Americans to   our   habits. ”We import salmon, tuna and shrimp,” says Nancy Civetta of the Cape Cod Commercial Fishermen’s Alliance. But ”we do not eat the [fish] we’re bringing to shore, right here!” Civetta says it’s good that fishermen have a market for their dogfish in Europe, but she argues we should be eating it here, too. She says a strong domestic market would strengthen the fisheries, making them less vulnerable to shifting preferences overseas. ”If we continue to import and buy from other countries, then our fishing industry could wither away,” Civetta says. And this would be a loss for coastal communities, she argues. So, is it possible to turn Americans onto dogfish? Chef Bob Bankert at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst thinks so. The university has contracted with Sea To Table, a company that connects domestic fishermen with chefs, universities and other buyers, to purchase dogfish. The campus serves 55, 000 meals a day and has made a big commitment to buying locally sourced foods. ”Being in western Massachusetts, we love to support the Massachusetts fisheries,” Bankert says. I watch as he grills dogfish fillets  —   ”it tastes great,” he vouches as he flips one over. We were curious to see if students agreed. We hung out for an afternoon as students sampled dogfish tacos, dogfish sushi and an Asian flash fry made with dogfish fillets and drizzled with wasabi mayo. ”Oh, it’s so good  —   amazing!” student Ruth Crawford told us as she finished off a taco. I asked her what the biggest appeal was. ”It’s new, it’s local, so healthy,” she told us. Some students were a bit turned off by the display of the whole dogfish  —   with its menacing shark appearance  —   that was showcased on the dining line. ”That’s scary looking,” one student told us as he walked by. Dining hall manager Selina Fournier says that’s where the storytelling comes in. When they saw the fish here today, she says, a lot of them didn’t know what to make of it. But once they learned more about   where it comes from, who caught it   and they got the chance to taste it, ”the whole association really . .. brings [the story] to life.” It’s not just universities that are promoting locally caught fish. Chefs, environmentalists and eaters across the country are embracing the concept of eating fish caught in a way that won’t lead to overfishing or environmental problems, while also supporting local fishing communities. The National Restaurant Association has named ”sustainable seafood” as one of its top 20 food trends for 2017. Sea to Table is about to launch a    online fish market. It’s scheduled to launch by the end of January. And this means that soon, Americans will be able to get dogfish and many other types of   species from U. S. fisheries delivered to our front doors. This story was reported as part of a collaboration with the PBS NewsHour."
"House Speaker Paul Ryan announced Thursday that Republicans will  —   once again  —   vote to cut off federal tax dollars for Planned Parenthood. They are planning to include the measure as part of a bigger upcoming bill to repeal pillars of Obamacare. This isn’t the first time that they have tried to pass this type of legislation  —   President Obama vetoed a similar bill last January. But with a Republican president about to take office, the party now has the best chance in more than a decade to get it signed into law. They also have a powerful legislative tool on their side: special budget rules that will let them offer their proposal on a measure that needs only 51 votes  —   meaning a Democratic filibuster can’t stop it. But the path to victory might not be totally clear, as   Trump’s position on abortion has wavered and allies of Planned Parenthood vow not to go down without a fight. Here are four key points to keep in mind as the parties gear up for a fight on Capitol Hill: 1. Planned Parenthood is not directly funded by the government, but it does receive payment from federal funds, This is a key distinction. While Planned Parenthood is not funded directly by the government, it does receive payment and grants from federal programs. Planned Parenthood’s clinics provide a number of health services, mostly for   women. And so consequently, the organization often bills Medicaid for reimbursement. It also receives funding through Title X, a federal grant program for family planning services. However, neither Medicaid nor Title X fund the abortion services, which many people associate with Planned Parenthood. Medicaid does have some narrow exceptions for this in the case of rape, incest or life of mother. And this gets at the heart of one of the nation’s longest running and divisive political debates  —   not only to what extent the federal government should direct its fiscal policy on women’s health matters, but whether abortion should be legal at all. 2. Planned Parenthood has become increasingly polarized: targeted by the GOP, championed by Democrats, Planned Parenthood has been a political target for years. But recently, the partisan polarization has gone beyond abortion rights and into any federal funds going to the organization. Republicans have more vehemently opposed Planned Parenthood in recent years for facilitating the transfer of fetal tissue for medical research. Concern over this practice led Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa to recently refer several Planned Parenthood affiliates to the FBI and the Department of Justice for further investigation. The issue of tissue transfer also became the subject of a select committee review, which released a heavily critical report this week. 3. Republicans aren’t quite sure Donald Trump is on their side  Republican lawmakers are confident in their effort, because for the first time in a decade, the party will control both chambers of Congress and the White House. But Donald Trump has a mixed record on Planned Parenthood. During the campaign, he praised the organization for doing ”very good work” for ”millions of women.” But he’s also supported cutting off federal funding. That said, Trump’s political inner circle is very much in favor of defunding the organization. Vice   Pence, for example, is a longtime leader in this effort with zero ambiguity in his record. He offered legislation to this effect when he was in the House. Speaker Ryan is also personally very much in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. But Ivanka Trump may be the person to watch. She has been a moderating force for her father on many women’s issues. 4. Planned Parenthood is gearing up for a fight, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards took to Twitter to respond to the GOP’s efforts saying, ”Not without one hell of a fight, they aren’t.” Richards may well be pointing to Senate Democrats’ past successes at defeating this type of legislation. They’ve succeeded in the past, in part, because of Republican allies  —   Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski  —   who they will likely need to lean on again. Beyond Capitol Hill, Planned Parenthood has   experience organizing and a loyal constituency. It is also a sponsor of the women’s march planned to protest Trump’s inauguration this month in Washington, which some estimates project as many as 200, 000 women may attend. Plus, to an extent, it has public opinion on its side. Public polling has consistently shown that the majority of Americans oppose cutting off all funding for Planned Parenthood. So, there is certainly at least some potential political risk for Republicans."
"Emil Girardi moved to San Francisco on New Year’s Eve in 1960. He loved everything about the city: the energy, the people and the hills. And, of course, the bars, where Girardi mixed drinks for most of his adult life. About 10 years ago, the    New York native had a stroke and collapsed on the sidewalk near his Nob Hill home. Everything changed. ”I didn’t want to go out of the house,” Girardi recalled, adding he only felt comfortable ”going from the bedroom to the dining room.” He’d started to fear the city’s streets  —   and growing older. An    friend worried about his isolation and called a San   nonprofit called Little Brothers, Friends of the Elderly. The organization works to relieve isolation and loneliness among the city’s seniors by pairing them with volunteers. Little Brothers matched him with Shipra Narruhn, a computer software trainer who has volunteered with various organizations over the years, and became involved with Little Brothers after her mother’s death. The organization started in France after World War II and now operates in several U. S. cities, including Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco. Cathy Michalec, the executive director of the local nonprofit, said older adults often become less mobile as they age. Cities like San Francisco, because of hills, crowded streets or old housing stock, are difficult for many seniors. That can lead to isolation and loneliness, Michalec said. ”Those 50 stairs you used to be able to go up and down all the time, you can’t go up and down all the time,” she said. ”The streets are crowded and sometimes unsafe. . .. Sometimes, our elders say, it’s easier to stay in the house.” Across the nation, geriatricians and other health and social service providers are growing increasingly worried about loneliness among seniors like Girardi. Their concerns are fueled by studies showing the emotional isolation is linked to serious health problems. Research shows older adults who feel lonely are at greater risk of memory loss, strokes, heart disease and high blood pressure. The health threat is similar to that of smoking 15 cigarettes a day, according to AARP. Researchers say that loneliness and isolation are linked to physical inactivity and poor sleep, as well as high blood pressure and poor immune functioning. A 2012 study showed that people who felt lonely  —   whether or not they lived with others or suffered from depression  —   were at heightened risk of death. It also showed that 43 percent of people over 60 felt lonely. ”If someone reports feeling lonely, they are more likely to lose their independence and they are at greater risk of dying solely from being lonely,” said Dr. Carla Perissinotto, a geriatrician and researcher at the University of California, San Francisco who authored the study. There can be many causes of loneliness, Perissinotto said, including illness, hearing loss or life changes such as retirement or the loss of a spouse. ”The usual social connections we have in younger life end up changing as we get older,” she said. Narruhn recalled that she and Girardi would just visit at his apartment, in the beginning. She’d tell him about her travels and her adult daughter. He’d tell her about his adventures in San Francisco. He described what the city was like as a young gay man, and told her about the friends he had lost to AIDS. They talked about music, books and cooking. ”I could tell from talking to him that he had a lot of interests,” she said. ”At one time, he was very sociable.” Gradually, Narruhn started bringing him music from Italy, India and Mexico. Girardi liked the songs he could snap his fingers to. Finally, Shipra convinced him to go out to lunch  —   and to visit a hidden,   staircase in San Francisco with her. ”Shipra came to see me, and came to see me and came to see me,” he said. ”Finally, she said, ’You have to get out of the house. ’” Soon, they were going to jazz shows, on walks and to the park. Narruhn said she invited Girardi to do eclectic things with her  —   chakra cleansings, Reiki healing sessions  —   and he was always game. Over time, his fear subsided. So did his loneliness. ”After she took me out of the house, then I didn’t want to stop,” Girardi said. There isn’t much research about the effectiveness of programs such as Little Brothers. But Perissinotto said they can help seniors build new social connections. Other efforts to address loneliness include roommate matching services in various states and, in the United Kingdom, a   hotline. ”Maintaining connections, that   thing, is actually really important,” Perissinotto said. ”It’s hard to measure, it’s hard to quantify, but there is something real. Even though we don’t have the exact research, we have tons of stories where we know it’s [had] an effect in people’s lives.” AARP Foundation also recently launched a nationwide online network to raise awareness about social isolation and loneliness among older adults. The network, Connect2Affect, allows people to do a   test and reach out to others feeling disconnected. AARP, the Gerontological Society of America and other organizations are hoping to help create more understanding of isolation and loneliness and to help lonely seniors build more social connections. ”Loneliness is a huge issue we don’t talk enough about,” said Dr. Charlotte Yeh, chief medical officer of AARP Services. ”There is a huge stigma.” One afternoon in November, Narruhn came by to take Girardi out to one of their favorite restaurants on Polk Street. The waiter greeted them by name. Over Italian food, they planned several more visits together. Girardi said he doesn’t fear growing older anymore. He’s surrounded by his new family. And by good music, he said, and ”snapping fingers.” Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

"Why do you do what you do? What is the engine that keeps you up late at night or gets you going in the morning? Where is your happy place? What stands between you and your ultimate dream? Heavy questions. One researcher believes that writing down the answers can be decisive for students. He   a paper that demonstrates a startling effect: nearly erasing the gender and ethnic minority achievement gap for 700 students over the course of two years with a short written exercise in setting goals.  Jordan Peterson teaches in the department of psychology at the University of Toronto. For decades, he has been fascinated by the effects of writing on organizing thoughts and emotions. Experiments going back to the 1980s have shown that ”therapeutic” or ”expressive” writing can reduce depression, increase productivity and even cut down on visits to the doctor. ”The act of writing is more powerful than people think,” Peterson says. Most people grapple at some time or another with   anxiety that saps energy and increases stress. Through written reflection, you may realize that a certain unpleasant feeling ties back to, say, a difficult interaction with your mother. That type of insight, research has shown, can help locate, ground and ultimately resolve the emotion and the associated stress. At the same time, ”  theory” holds that writing down concrete, specific goals and strategies can help people overcome obstacles and achieve. ’It Turned My Life Around’ Recently, researchers have been getting more and more interested in the role that mental motivation plays in academic achievement  —   sometimes conceptualized as ”grit” or ”growth mindset” or ”executive functioning.” Peterson wondered whether writing could be shown to affect student motivation. He created an undergraduate course called Maps of Meaning. In it, students complete a set of writing exercises that combine expressive writing with  . Students reflect on important moments in their past, identify key personal motivations and create plans for the future, including specific goals and strategies to overcome obstacles. Peterson calls the two parts ”past authoring” and ”future authoring.” ”It completely turned my life around,” says Christine Brophy, who, as an undergraduate several years ago, was battling drug abuse and health problems and was on the verge of dropping out. After taking Peterson’s course at the University of Toronto, she changed her major. Today she is a doctoral student and one of Peterson’s main research assistants.  In an early study at McGill University in Montreal, the course showed a powerful positive effect with   students, reducing the dropout rate and increasing academic achievement. Peterson is seeking a larger audience for what he has dubbed ” .” He started a   company and is selling a version of the curriculum online. Brophy and Peterson have found a receptive audience in the Netherlands. At the Rotterdam School of Management, a shortened version of   has been mandatory for all   students since 2011. (These are undergraduates  —   they choose majors early in Europe). The latest paper, published in June, compares the performance of the first complete class of freshmen to use   with that of the three previous classes. Overall, the ” ” students greatly improved the number of credits earned and their likelihood of staying in school. And after two years, ethnic and   differences in performance among the students had all but disappeared. The ethnic minorities in question made up about   of the students. They are   and   immigrants from   backgrounds  —   Africa, Asia and the Middle East. While the history and legacy of racial oppression are different from that in the United States, the Netherlands still struggles with large differences in wealth and educational attainment among majority and minority groups. ’Zeroes Are Deadly’ At the Rotterdam school, minorities generally underperformed the majority by more than a third, earning on average eight fewer credits their first year and four fewer credits their second year. But for minority students who had done this set of writing exercises, that gap dropped to five credits the first year and to just   of one credit in the second year. How could a bunch of essays possibly have this effect on academic performance? Is this replicable? Melinda Karp is the assistant director for staff and institutional development at the Community College Research Center at Teachers College, Columbia University. She leads studies on interventions that can improve college completion. She calls Peterson’s paper ”intriguing.” But, she adds, ”I don’t believe there are silver bullets for any of this in higher ed.” Peterson believes that formal   can especially help minority students overcome what’s often called ”stereotype threat,” or, in other words, to reject the damaging belief that generalizations about   academic performance will apply to them personally. Karp agrees. ”When you enter a new social role, such as entering college as a student, the expectations aren’t always clear.” There’s a greater risk for students who may be academically underprepared or who lack role models. ”Students need help not just setting vague goals but figuring out a plan to reach them.” The key for this intervention came at crunch time, says Peterson. ”We increased the probability that students would actually take their exams and hand in their assignments.” The act of   helped them overcome obstacles when the stakes were highest. ”You don’t have to be a genius to get through school you don’t even have to be that interested. But zeroes are deadly.” Karp has a theory for how this might be working. She says you often see   students engage in   behavior ”to save face.” ”If you aren’t sure you belong in college, and you don’t hand in that paper,” she explains, ”you can say to yourself, ’That’s because I didn’t do the work, not because I don’t belong here.’ ” Writing down their internal motivations and connecting daily efforts to   goals may have helped these young people solidify their identities as students. Brophy is testing versions of the   curriculum at two high schools in Rotterdam, and monitoring their psychological   school attendance and tendency to procrastinate. Early results are promising, she says: ”It helps students understand what they really want to do.”"
"Classical composers have long had their patrons: Beethoven had Archduke Rudolph, John Cage had Betty Freeman. For contemporary opera composers, there’s Beth Morrison. She and her production company have commissioned new works from some of the most innovative emerging composers today. Morrison is not your typical moneyed patron, though. ”I didn’t come from money and I didn’t have money and I wanted to live in New York!” she says. She runs her empire from a     apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn. One bedroom in the apartment is for sleeping. The other is a workspace for her eight employees. ”I’ve always run the business from my home, maybe much to the chagrin of my board,” she says. ”For me, the decision is always really clear: I could spend $30 to $40, 000 on an office space every year, or I could put that into a commission.” Morrison has commissioned works from David T. Little, Mohammed Fairouz and Missy Mazzoli. Mazzoli, whose first opera, Song from the Uproar, was produced by Morrison, calls her a true individual. ”Beth has this famous boot collection that is just amazing  —   it blows my mind,” Mazzoli says. ”It’s sort of a symbol of this commitment of being an individual and to being an iconoclast and to doing things her own way.” Morrison says she follows her guts and her ears in her work. ”I won’t do anything unless I’m mad crazy about the music and the composer and really feeling like they’re contributing something to the field that is different,” she says. David T. Little says Morrison expressed this kind of excitement for his work Soldier Songs after she watched a video he sent her. ”[She] called me almost immediately and says, ’We have to do this piece. I don’t know where we’re gonna get the money, I don’t know how we’re gonna do it . .. but we have to do it! ’” he says. Little says this moment was a perfect illustration of how Morrison works: When she’s excited about something, she makes it happen. Their work together has continued: Last year, Morrison featured Little’s   opera, Dog Days, at Prototype, the annual festival she   (with Kristin Marting and Kim Whitener of the arts organization HERE) to showcase new work. The 2017 festival begins tonight in New York. Morrison doesn’t have her own theater. Instead, she partners with venues in New York and around the country to give works more than one hearing. ”[Composers] need their works to be seen by as many people as possible,” she says. ”I feel like I’ve succeeded  —   particularly with an opera project, ’cause they’re large and expensive  —   if we’ve been able to give two to five presentations of the piece in different cities.” One project that achieved success by this metric was Mazzoli’s latest opera, Breaking the Waves. Last fall, Morrison partnered with Opera Philadelphia to present the piece, and it’s now being done at this year’s Prototype festival. Kamala Sankaram, whose opera Thumbprint premiered at the first Prototype, will see it restaged at LA Opera this June, thanks to Morrison’s efforts. Morrison’s commitment to extending the life of her composers’ works has made them just as passionately devoted to her as she is to them. Sankaram says Morrison’s work is not easy. ”To make contemporary opera your business takes a lot of guts,” Sankaram says. ”I don’t want to go there too much, but there’s still a lot of sexism in our field, and so for her to do this on her own is really kind of astonishing.” Morrison’s current season includes five world premieres, nine tours and her annual festival  —   all funded and produced out of her   nonprofit. Her schedule is certainly packed, but she says championing new composers has been intensely rewarding work. ”It’s been thrilling to be a part of the launch of these incredible composers,” she says. ”It really has been this symbiotic relationship that I feel very grateful for.”"
"Even before Barack Obama moved into the White House, he and his team made a choice that made actually selling his policies to the public more difficult. In December 2008, Obama’s economic team gathered in Chicago to map out what would become the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. ”A dispute, discussion, something breaks out at that meeting. We haven’t even come in yet,” said Austan Goolsbee, a professor at the University of Chicago, who was a top economic adviser in the early years of the Obama presidency. Goolsbee said there were two schools of thought about how to proceed. ”Doing something on the order of magnitude of the problem, which everyone understood is going to be a collection of a whole bunch of things and you’re going to have a hard time explaining it” was one option, Goolsbee said. Or, he said, others argued, ” ’Couldn’t we just pick one thing and just do that one thing?’ And that would be really easy to explain.” The economy was hemorrhaging jobs, and Obama’s economic team was afraid the country was on the brink of another Great Depression. The president chose to go big. Obama came into the White House eight years ago, hailed as the ”Great Communicator” because of his lofty speeches, but as he leaves office  —   and delivers a farewell address Tuesday night in Chicago  —   by his own admission, Obama hasn’t always been so adept at communicating his policies and achievements. He struggled to make the sell on the Recovery Act (known as the stimulus) the auto bailout and the Affordable Care Act. The man who will succeed him has chosen a decidedly different path.   Donald Trump has on multiple occasions hyped up announcements by companies that they will add a few thousand or even fewer jobs, declaring victory and getting lots of attention for relatively small wins, as compared with the size of the U. S. economy. Obama has overseen 75 straight months of job growth. Employers added millions of jobs during the course of his presidency, but Obama hasn’t been able to capitalize on that politically as well as his allies would have hoped. Obama signed the Recovery Act in February 2009. And in the speech he made that day, the challenges of explaining the behemoth $780 billion package were clear. ”Today does mark the beginning of the end,” Obama said, ”the beginning of what we need to do to create jobs for Americans scrambling in the wake of layoffs.” He talked about the millions of jobs it would ”save or create,” a metric so squishy it proved hard for Obama to claim credit for it later and made it easy for opponents to criticize the stimulus as a failure. He spent most of the speech talking about ”investments.” ”Rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, repairing our faulty dams and levees, bringing critical broadband connections to businesses and homes in nearly every community in America,” Obama said in what was a long list of projects. ”Upgrading mass transit.” But Frank Luntz, who has advised Republicans on messaging, said in an interview with NPR that the word ”investment” can sound, for some, like code for   spending. ”There was real hostility early on,” Luntz said, ”a feeling that it’s just an expansion of Washington and nobody was going to benefit and everyone was going to get stuck with the tab.” Obama’s team overestimated Americans’ appetite for stimulus spending, Luntz argued. Republicans in Congress, who never supported the Recovery Act, repeatedly derided it as a ”failed   stimulus.” In reality, a big chunk of it went to tax cuts  —   and it helped pull the country out of the biggest recession since the Great Depression. In Obama’s   speech, the mention of those tax cuts came near the end. ”About a third of this package comes in the forms of tax cuts  —   by the way, the most progressive in our history,” said Obama to applause, arguing it would not only spur job creatio, but put ”money in the pockets of 95 percent of   families in America.” The way the tax cuts were distributed also limited any public relations benefit. The money just appeared in people’s paychecks as a smaller payroll tax deduction. ”Nobody realized, nobody understood and, so, nobody celebrated it,” Luntz said. ”There’s a simple rule in politics: If you don’t talk about it, no one knows you did it, and you get no credit for it. And that was the problem with the   component of Obama’s stimulus package.” The tax cut was carefully designed by the Obama administration to target   and   Americans. But it ultimately had little traction with the public  —   or with Republicans whom it was intended to help sway. ”At one point in the first year,” Goolsbee said, remembering a moment of great frustration, ”there’s a poll that comes out in which something like 60 percent of the country said that they were sick of the tax increases that had come from the stimulus, when, in fact, 95 percent had gone down.” Goolsbee said that is when he began to realize that reality was relative  —   something that has truly taken hold in American politics now. ”And at that point, you know the president was basically asking the economic team, ’What is wrong with you people?’ and I just felt like punching myself,” said Goolsbee with a laugh. Economists widely view the stimulus as having helped the economy avoid disaster. But politically, Obama got none of the credit for the tax cuts and a whole lot of grief for the spending. This was a pattern that would repeat itself throughout his presidency. As Trump prepares to enter the White House, his communications strategy is one of mass saturation, including   tweets on multiple topics. Will that work out better than Obama’s cool focus on facts and figures when trying to convince the public? Or as he works to repeal some of Obama’s policy achievements, will he have to adopt a different tactic to sell his proposals?"
"The end of 2016 marked a grim milestone in Chicago. More than 4, 000 people were shot over the course of the year, and 762 people were homicide victims, according to the Chicago Tribune. Those numbers are higher than the totals of New York and Los Angeles combined. To be clear, other cities, like New Orleans and Detroit, had higher rates of gun violence and murder on a per capita basis. But nowhere were the sheer, raw numbers as staggering as they were in Chicago. NPR’s Michel Martin spoke with a variety of voices in Chicago  —   those who have been personally affected by the violence people who have been involved in it themselves, and officials at the federal and local level who are trying to fix it. The story that emerged was one of frustration, and fear, with no clear silver bullet toward fixing the problem. But there’s also a sense of hope, even from those who have suffered the deepest. Illinois Congressman Danny Davis remembers exactly where he was when he got the phone call just a few weeks ago, in November. ”One of the police commanders was on the phone and he said, ’I have some bad news to tell you,’ Davis recalls. ”And I said, ’Bad news? Well, I’m pretty accustomed to bad news.” The longtime Chicago Democrat has performed eulogies for some two dozen young Chicagoans who have been killed. But this phone call was different. ”He says, ’I want you to just brace yourself. I understand that your grandson may have been shot. ’” Javon Wilson, 15, was killed in a dispute over shoes and clothes, according to police. Davis says it arose from a ”swapping group,” where kids borrowed each other’s clothes in a trading system. The    congressman choked back tears, as he recounted hearing the news. ”I couldn’t, for the moment, think. And by then, my son called, and I said, ’Oh yeah, I heard that Javon. ..’ (And my son) says, ’Daddy, he’s gone. ..’” Davis says he has no choice but to find some sort of silver lining out of this. He’s doubling down on his efforts to strengthen gun laws, and prevent similar tragedies from occurring again. That’s despite a   legislature, which has shown little appetite for stricter gun laws. ”There are millions and millions of people who think about guns the same way that I do,” Davis says. ”You know, one of my favorite songs, something by a guy named Sam Cooke used to sing   oh, it is so profound. ’It may be a long time coming, but I know some change is going to come.’ That’s the way I feel about this issue.” No consensus as to why Chicago has been hit hard by violence, Although there’s no consensus as to why Chicago has been hit so hard by violence, there are a few factors that officials point to again and again: Guns and poverty. ”You put those two volatile things together and you end up with folks with guns and no purpose in life and killing people for no reasonable purpose at all,” says Davis’ Senate colleague, minority whip Dick Durbin (D  —   IL). Durbin, among others, points out that geography might also play an important role in Chicago’s misfortunes. The city is seen as a centrally located hub for gun and drug trafficking. ”Our city of Chicago is awash in guns. They come in from every direction, from the suburbs, from Northern Indiana gun shows, from Mississippi for goodness sakes. They make it into the city. They’re confiscated in these gun crimes at a rate of about one an hour every day, every week, every month.” ”My wife said, ’Somebody has to do something.’ And I realized, I am somebody. I’m the senator from the state of Illinois. You know, I’m doing my best to understand what I can do from the federal level. But yes, I care, and a lot of people care. And this killing has to stop.”   Donald Trump is another voice suggesting federal intervention. Earlier this month he tweeted about Chicago’s violence, as he sees it. ”Chicago murder rate is record setting   4, 331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can’t do it he must ask for Federal help!” Durbin, for one, says he’d be open to that sort of help. ”The mayor suggested an increase in the police department, and we need some federal funds to help us do that. We need resources and training and equipment. And [Trump] could help us do it. I hope he will.” Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s office declined a formal interview request. But the city did make available Chicago’s recently hired police chief, Eddie Johnson, who spoke to Martin from member station WBEZ in Chicago: ”Chicago has a gun problem. That’s where our violence stems from. To be honest, Chicago isn’t out of control, but we have five police districts that are actually responsible for the majority of the increase in our gun violence this year. But I think one of the main factors that contribute to it is the fact that we do a terrible job of holding repeat gun offenders accountable for their crimes. ”The violence in Chicago is not just about what police are or are not doing. We have   issues. The economic support that we have to give these impoverished areas, the mental health treatment, better education, better housing   all of that stuff matters. ”But I tell you when it comes to morale, you look at what happened the other day when those beat officers found a young man wandering down the street. If they didn’t care and if morale wasn’t good, they didn’t have to stop and investigate that to the extent that they did to find out what happened.” Johnson was referring to yet another black eye for Chicago. Four teenagers have been charged with hate crimes, for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an acquaintance with special needs. Police say the victim was approached by police, after he escaped, looking disoriented and disheveled. Hate crimes not common, but social media use is, NPR’s Cheryl Corley, who is based in Chicago, says the story is grabbing headlines locally, as well as nationally, ”People are just really shocked by this. You know, what we know about the case is that it started off with the victim and a suspect he considered to be a friend hanging out.” The victim was white, and the black suspects allegedly used racial slurs against him. But Corley says the crime doesn’t really fit the pattern associated with much of the violence in the city, which has been fueled by gangs and guns. ”I think that the only thing that may be common with what’s happening with gun violence here is that the Facebook suspects used social media to broadcast what was happening,” she told Martin. ”And we often have cases where gang members here will post something on social media, often some sort of taunt, that sparks some of the gun violence that occurs here.” One way the incident may be similar to others, however, is that the victim knew his attackers. Some researchers, notably Yale professor Andrew Papachristos and Dr. Gary Slutkin of the University of Illinois at Chicago, say that nugget could hold the key to predicting, and eventually preventing violent crime in places like Chicago. ”So if I get shot, for instance, there’s a high likelihood that the people around me in my networks will also be victims and that, then, their friends will be victims. And their friends’ friends will be victims,” Papachristos tells Corley. ”It is contagious and that, when it’s managed as a health issue, you can rapidly drop it and sustain drops for long periods of time,” Slutkin adds. Slutkin heads a group called CureViolence. The group uses data to predict who might be involved in disputes, that might turn violent, and then sends ”interrupters” to try to stop things from escalating. But Corley reports the program has been mainly dropped in Chicago, due to funding shortages. The state’s ongoing budget woes have widely been blamed as another obstacle to stopping violence in the streets. In places like Austin on Chicago’s West Side, or Englewood and Chatham, on the South Side, there’s nothing abstract or academic about gang life. Gang life can be a death sentence, Edwin Day, Mario Hardiman and Andre Evans are all former gang members. All of them say their family structures were crumbling, and they were drawn to gangs for both structure, and safety. ”Most of the other people in the neighborhood were the pimps, drug dealers, dice shooters, ticket scalpers, some type of hustler, some type of, you know, shyster,” Hardiman told Martin. ”So I looked up to those characters and eventually became somewhat of a few of those characters myself   gambling and selling drugs, using marijuana.” Evans tells a similar story. ”I felt isolated, you know   the whole emotional thing. You’re just dealing with my emotions and not having my biological father in my life. ”That was the number one source of why I wanted to   why I got involved in (Gangster Disciple Nation). And I think the second reason was really to protect my brothers as well. You know, there would be a lot of times when, you know, people would be having hits out on my brothers or things happening to my brothers and just in a lot of ways, it was a way for me to protect them. Day recalls to Martin an incident where he was shot nine times in a gang dispute. DAY: Well, I was involved in gang life. I felt that there was others that was trying to do to me and my people bodily harm, and so we felt at the time that we would protect ourselves at all costs. And so there were times that I would pick up a gun and try to shoot people. I didn’t   I’ve never done it or I never shot anybody, but I have shot a gun and tried to shoot people. And the ironic thing about that, I guess, things come full circle. I was shot. And so. .. MARTIN: That’s part of the story, isn’t it? DAY: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. MARTIN: That people are as likely to be victims as they are to be perpetrators. Right? So why   what happened with that? Why did you get shot? DAY: And so what happened was   like I say   we were involved in gangs and drugs, and so you’re talking about monies being exchanged. And so that’s what changes. That’s where the violence heightens when you talk about drugs and monies and things of a sort. And so at this particular time, we were in what was called a gang war. And so guys would come in and try to shoot us and kill us, and we would kind of go back and forth try to shoot them and kill them. And so one particular night, I was in a home where we were kind engaging in all of this negative activity. I was leaving out and actually prepared to go and put my gear on to go and cause somebody else harm. And so unknowing to myself as I walked down the stairs, there was a guy that was waiting for me on the side of the building in the bushes or what have you. And he could have killed me. I will say that he could have killed me because he could have waited ’til I got to the bottom step and just kind of walk right up on me and shot me in the back of the head, but he didn’t. And I thank God for that. He waited until I kind of got to the edge of the curb, and he rose up out of the gangway and he started to shoot me. And so as I ran, I’m running across the street trying to get to my house, and I kind of catch one in the back of my leg. And I felt that and from then I continued to catch numerous shots   my back, my leg, my arms   all over. It was a total of nine shots that I ended up receiving. I can remember it kind of like it was yesterday. I was telling myself if I can just make it to the other side of the street, I’ll be fine. And so he continued to shoot, unload on me. And I did make it. I did make it to the other side of the street. And by the time I made it to the other side of street, I had caught so many shots that I just kind of collapsed right there. He was gone. I was down. And that’s what happened. Unintended consequences another problem, Another problem, according to experts and former gang members, is one of unintended consequences. When authorities cracked down on gang leadership  —   rank and file members no longer had gang hierarchy to ensure order. Large groups devolved into   factions. And that in turn led to chaos on the streets. ”When you have different factions, you don’t have leadership, and people can kind of run amok and do what they want to do,” Evans says. ”And they be like oh,    come from this block, so we going to mess with him like that, you know, just do random  ’  as they say, just because    comes from that side of the street per se. You know, and I had one of my best friends in high school who, you know, tried to join a gang, and they beat his jaw in with the gun.” Day, Hardiman, and Evans now all talk to   youth about avoiding the gang life. And despite their harrowing stories, they say they haven’t given up hope that things can get better, even if some young people in the city have. Hardiman says the government has to step up and help the black community. Evans advises young kids to find a legitimate ”hustle” to focus on, instead of turning to the streets. Day says the answer lies within every person in Chicago, who can either ignore the problem, hide from it, or try to stop it. ”I think that it starts by really having a love and a concern for someone other than yourself, to be able to go out and say, ’You know what? Let me go in and let me grab one. I’ll just grab it. It doesn’t have to be a whole group of young people, but let me grab one and talk to him.’ I think that it starts with love. It starts with compassion. It starts with caring for someone other than yourself. ’”"
"The morning of Oct. 18, 2016, the employees at La Divina, a taqueria and Mexican grocery in Buffalo, N. Y. were prepping for the lunch crowd  —   making salsa, grilling chicken and stocking the shelves with Mexican Cokes and Corona beer. Suddenly, agents from Homeland Security Investigations rushed in. ”I heard someone shouting, ’Don’t move! Don’t move!’ It was ICE,” says Jose Antonio Ramos, a    Mexican cook working illegally, in Spanish. ICE stands for U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ”I was in shock. I was complying with their orders, but they were mistreating us,” he says. ”They pointed guns at our heads. They pushed us on the floor and handcuffed us. They brought in dogs.” Beefy federal agents hauled out computers and cash registers while local news crews filmed. The raid of La Divina and three other restaurants under the same owner became one of the nation’s biggest immigration worksite actions in recent years. In all, 14 workers have been charged with civil and criminal immigration violations. Twelve more workers were found to be in the country illegally, but they were released because they didn’t meet the government’s enforcement priorities. The owner and his two managers are charged with harboring unauthorized immigrants. The federal criminal complaint alleges the trio provided workers with housing and transportation, paid them in cash off the books and avoided income taxes. Sergio Mucino, a    lawful permanent resident from Mexico City, owns the four restaurants ICE raided. During a recent lunch rush, Mucino is spotted making tacos behind the counter at La Divina with some newly hired workers. He declines to discuss the raid because his case is ongoing, but he is happy to talk about his menu. ”We try to offer authentic street tacos, make it more like a Mexican atmosphere,” he says as patrons line up to order ribeye and chorizo tacos. While Mucino is out on bail and reopening his restaurants one by one, most of his illegal workforce is out of a job and facing deportation. This was the aftermath of the raid despite an ICE statement that they were targeting the abusive employer, not his employees. Over at a lunch counter, Jeff Dugan, who works at a local marketing company, digs into a plate of chicken quesadillas. Dugan says he supports the ICE raid. ”I want the workers to be in good standing and . .. working under our laws and [well] taken care of,” he says, ”because when they’re not, they get put in subpar housing and they’re getting underpaid and overworked.” Thirteen hours a day, six days a week are what Ramos and his coworkers put in. They earned the equivalent of $6. 50 an hour  —   below the federal minimum wage. ”I guess my only complaint would be the long hours,” Ramos says. ”But you need to make money to eat and take care of your family. You have no choice.” The father of three children from San Luis Potosi, Mexico, wears an electronic ankle monitor and faces a civil violation for overstaying a work visa at a different restaurant that paid him even less. The city has rallied around the Buffalo restaurant workers who are facing removal. Churches are supporting them with food and rent assistance while they await their immigration hearings. Local sympathizers have demonstrated outside the ICE office in this Northern border city and circulated a petition asking federal authorities to let the workers go. An ICE spokesman defends the raid. He says they focused on Mucino, but during the course of the investigation they learned some of his workers had   the country after being deported, which is a felony. But some locals are asking if these relatively minor violations are a reason for federal agents to storm restaurant kitchens with handguns drawn and police dogs. ”It’s really small potatoes and so it really did shock this community,” says Nicole Hallett, an immigration law professor at the University of Buffalo. She represents four of the workers. ”I think it did shock the national immigration rights community.” Most immigration offenses are civil, not criminal, but there are exceptions. ”Criminal  ” is the charge when someone is previously deported or removed from the U. S. and comes back. Unauthorized immigrants who are deported often turn right around and make multiple attempts to   U. S. territory. ”But most of the time when someone gets charged with criminal   it’s because they have other criminal history,” says Hallett, puzzled. ”So [federal prosecutors] very rarely will indict someone with criminal   if that is the only thing that they have.” That’s what happened in Buffalo. Big,   worksite sweeps were common under President George W. Bush. President Obama has mostly taken a more   approach, such as auditing employer records to make sure all the workers have valid Social Security numbers. ”You need it all. You need audits, but you need an enforcement action now and again,” says a top ICE official in Washington, who asked not to be named. ”We’re trying to send that chilling effect to employers [to say] you need to think twice” about exploiting illegal workers. Yet Hallett says these raids can easily backfire. ”If one of your goals is to protect workers from exploitation, obviously arresting those workers as part of an enforcement action makes workers very afraid to come forward and report if there is exploitation happening,” she says. Obama’s Homeland Security team will be gone soon and there will be a new sheriff in town.   Trump and his advisers have talked about cracking down on unauthorized immigrants and the job magnets that attract them. It’s reasonable to ask if, under Trump, the Buffalo restaurant raid will become the norm rather than the exception."
"Nat Hentoff, the author of dozens of books and decades of columns, has died at 91. His son Nick Hentoff confirmed his father’s death on Twitter Saturday night. Hentoff was a writer for the Village Voice for 50 years. He also wrote for many publications over his lengthy career, including The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The New Yorker, United Media syndicate and Down Beat magazine. He frequently wrote about issues surrounding civil liberties  —   the Voice describes him as a ”civil libertarian.” His 1982 novel The Day They Came to Arrest the Book tells the story of a high school that seeks to remove the book Huckleberry Finn from the school curriculum and library over racism and other issues. A student from the school newspaper fights the effort  —   an allegory on censorship. He also was a lover and frequent writer on jazz music. From age 11, he was hooked on the genre after hearing the song ”Nightmare” by Artie Shaw coming through an open door at a record store. ”It just reached inside me,” Hentoff told NPR’s Guy Raz in 2010. ”I rushed into the store, ’What was that?’ ” Over the six decades he spent covering jazz, he attended plenty of performances and met many musicians. He ”got to be very good friends” with jazz great Dizzy Gillespie. At one point, he sat in on a recording session featuring Abbey Lincoln, Coleman Hawkins and Max Roach. ”The music just became part of you as you heard it,” Hentoff said of the experience. His most memorable show he attended was Duke Ellington ”with his full orchestra” at Symphony Hall in Boston, playing the jazz work ”Black, Brown and Beige.” ”It was the history of black people in the United States from slavery to the present,” Hentoff told NPR in 2010. ”And it was so extraordinary. At the end . .. people were so moved they could barely applaud until they gave a standing ovation.” Hentoff started writing for the Village Voice in 1958 until he was ”excessed” in 2008 by new managers. A few days after his firing, he told NPR that condolences he received from readers afterward were ”like reading one’s obituary while you’re still alive.” But he vowed to keep writing. In his final column for the Voice in 2009, he recalled advice he received from one of his mentors in journalism, the muckraker I. F. Stone: ”If you’re in this business because you want to change the world, get another day job. If you are able to make a difference, it will come incrementally, and you might not even know about it. You have to get the story and keep on it because it has to be told.”"
"Availability is the best ability for Keith ”Bang Bang” McCurdy. ”I’m waiting all the time for that call, because I know Justin Bieber may call me at three in the morning and I have to tattoo him at six. That has happened,” McCurdy says. Bang Bang is considered one of the most successful tattoo artists in the industry. The New   artist is credited for creating some of the most iconic tattoos on celebrities. Like fashion model Cara Delevingne’s simple yet   lion tattoo that sits on her index finger. And pop star Rihanna’s henna design that wraps across her wrist and drips down her fingertips. In fact, it was Bang Bang’s work of art for Rihanna in 2007, when he was just 19 years old, that helped to catapult his career. Now 29, Bang Bang reflects on his journey from Pottstown, P. A.  —   a city about 40 miles northwest of Philadelphia  —   to how he got his big break. Keith McCurdy was born to teenage parents. His mother was a    high school dropout who worked at Domino’s Pizza, while his dad, who finished high school and went on to college, was scarcely around to father him, McCurdy recalls. This resulted in McCurdy being raised primarily by his mom. When he was 3 years old, McCurdy moved with his mom from Pennsylvania to a public housing unit in Delaware. There, his mom became an exotic dancer and he says this sometimes exposed him to a somewhat unsavory lifestyle. But the most challenging part, he says, was watching his mom struggle to put food on the table. That early hardship, however, forced McCurdy to grow up fast. In school, he struggled to keep up and was easily distracted by friends and the occasional recreational drug use. And while his dad was often absent from his life, whenever he did come around, he always stressed to McCurdy the importance of education. Thus, at age 13, tired of failing grades and getting into trouble, McCurdy heeded his dad’s advice to be a better student and convinced his parents to send him to boarding school in Connecticut. Leaving home for the first time, Two years later, McCurdy was thriving in boarding school. By now, he’d gotten his first exposure to tattoos and wanted one. His parents weren’t enthusiastic about the idea, but McCurdy struck a deal with them that if he made the honor roll, they’d let him get a tattoo. ”So I made the honor roll and I got a tattoo, and it was a great experience for me because it really fueled my interest more,” McCurdy says. He was 15 years old. By this time, McCurdy notes, he’d gained more   and discipline. It appeared that his life was on track. But then he did what he describes as ”something stupid.” He was gearing up for college, filling out applications and getting his portfolio together McCurdy was interested in graphic design. And despite finally getting his act together and excelling in school, McCurdy cheated on a Spanish test. This got him kicked out of boarding school. He found himself back in Delaware living with his mother and working   at Red Lobster, while trying to complete his high school diploma at a public school. Getting kicked out of boarding school was devastating for McCurdy. He’d liked it there, it inspired him and he felt like he was doing something positive with his life. It was also there  —   after he got his first tattoo  —   that he realized he wanted more. But with no money to pay for them, McCurdy thought of the next best thing  —   creating them from scratch. He felt that he could express himself through designing tattoos. McCurdy ordered a tattoo kit online and when it came in the mail, he walked into his mother’s kitchen, sat down and started to tattoo. ”And every day since, it’s with that enthusiasm and love, that I continued to tattoo,” he says. After three months of tattooing at home on himself and on everyone he knew, McCurdy landed a job at his dad’s friend’s tattoo shop outside a nearby trailer park. He quit his job at Red Lobster, dropped out of school and focused solely on tattooing. ”In hindsight it was a terrible decision, I mean it worked out, but man, I dropped out of high school to tattoo outside of a trailer park. And I tattooed guns on [my] neck and I had no choice other than to succeed at it,” McCurdy says. It was from tattooing the guns that McCurdy earned the nickname, ”Bang Bang.” He says the guns also symbolized that this was what he was going to do for the rest of his life. New York City has more skin, Still, McCurdy thought he could take his skills further than the trailer park tattoo shop. He wanted more. So he scoped the industry and studied his craft. He knew who the big players were, and he knew that if he wanted to grow he would have to leave his neighborhood. So McCurdy packed up and moved to New York City. ”New York City just has more people,” he says. ”So it was simply my thought that, well, there’s more skin, I’m going to go where the skin is  —   so if that’s my canvas I’m going to go there.” Upon moving to New York City, McCurdy had a hard time finding work. This    tattoo artist from Delaware found himself in the Big Apple going from tattoo shop to tattoo shop passing around his portfolio. He says many tattoo shop owners had a hard time believing that it was his work in the book because of how impressive it was to the eye. He had to find another way to stand out. ”When I moved to NYC I lost that funny little nickname,” he says. ”I didn’t tell people my name was Bang Bang, I told people my name was Keith. And the problem is Keith McCurdy isn’t really easy to remember, but nobody forgets Bang Bang. So I started telling people my name was Bang Bang and it was really great for me.” From then on out there was no more Keith McCurdy there was only Bang Bang. This is what she came for, After several months, Bang Bang finally landed a job at a grungy, dark basement tattoo shop on the Lower East Side. It was here where he’d meet the girl that would launch his career and forever change his life. A couple of months after he landed his first gig in New York, Bang Bang was tattooing in the basement when he recalls a group of five or six, tall, beautiful women walking into the shop. They asked the man at the front who was the best tattoo artist, the man said Bang Bang. Bang Bang’s coworker then told him that a singer wanted to get a tattoo. That singer was Barbadian   pop star, Rihanna. Rihanna, then 18, wanted a Sanskrit prayer etched along her thigh. The next day, Rihanna came into the shop with a reporter. They all sat down in the window of the tattoo shop storefront. Slowly, people began to gather around the window to watch. Bang Bang turned on his machine and started to ink Rihanna’s skin as the reporter interviewed her. ”For me, it was very difficult to make that tattoo. Because she’s talking and she moves a lot when she talks, and she’s speaking with her hands. And I’m like, ’There’s this girl who will not sit still, and everyone’s watching me, and I’m stressing out,’ ” Bang Bang says. In the end, the tattoo turned out great. Rihanna was happy, so all was good in the world. Word of mouth quickly spread Bang Bang’s success on the pop singer’s tattoo. This opened the door for more career opportunities, and Bang Bang made sure he was ready. He’s created a brand, a tattoo empire. ”Bang Bang” is no longer just his nickname, it’s the name of the store he opened where he now manages 16 artists. He’s Rihanna’s   tattoo artist, and has also inked celebrities such as Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Lebron James and Miley Cyrus, just to name a few. Through it all, Bang Bang falls back on one principle: being available. So much so, that for his first 10 years in New York, he didn’t take a vacation  —   and he’s made sure to not repeat the mistakes of his younger years in abusing alcohol or using drugs. ”I may need to fly across the planet because Lebron calls at 9 p. m. and I have to fly on this first flight the next morning,” Bang Bang says. ”I have to sort out my whole world to get it done, but saying yes and making sure I am able to do it is what really laid the foundation for the opportunities that came.”"
"The world of global health and development loves its buzzwords  —   a word or short phrase that sums up a problem or a solution, like ”food insecurity” or ”gender equity.” The problem is that buzzwords aren’t always clear to the average global citizen. And some folks in the development world don’t like them either. Here’s The International Development Jargon Detector to prove it. Still, the latest jargon can reveal a lot about trends and goals. We asked our sources and our audience on Twitter to share buzzwords from 2016 that are likely to be part of the global conversation in the year ahead. And we checked to see what words are trending. Here’s a sampling. A haze of air pollution  —   think pea soup fog but toxic. The word’s been around but resurfaced in the past few months after particularly bad airpocalypses in India and China. In December, Beijing issued its first red alert of 2016 after five days of smog was forecast. Schools were shut down, people wore surgical masks to filter out the fumes and flights were canceled because of poor visibility. There was even a trending hashtag, #themostserioussmog, which prompted citizens across Chinese social media site Weibo to share photos of their experience. Use it in a sentence: During airpocalypse, the wealthiest schoolchildren in Beijing can expect to play soccer under an inflatable   dome.  They’re not doctors or nurses. But they’ve received some basic training in medical skills and play a vital role in places where there’s a lack of health workers  —   often in remote parts of   countries but in the U. S. as well, where there are 48, 000 CHWs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In December, CHWs had their moment in the sun when Dr. Raj Panjabi won a $1 million TED Prize for founding Last Mile Health, an organization that uses CHWs to provide health care in isolated parts of Liberia. Use it in a sentence: By day, she runs a beauty salon, but by night, she’s a CHW, educating women about contraception. The act of collecting data and using it to predict or shape behavior  —   like keeping track of your steps with a FitBit so you can decide if you need to amp up your exercise program. The word’s been around for years but got new life in the global community last year as technologists started thinking of ways to use data, like disease outbreaks, DNA and financial transactions, to improve people’s lives. Some companies in China, for example, are feeding weather data into a computer with artificial intelligence software to predict   events  —   like an airpocalypse  —   in advance. Use it in a sentence: Activists are hoping that the datafication of air quality data can help bring more funding for   programs. Around the world, there are 1 billion people who live without power. They can’t automate agricultural processes like milling grain to produce more food to sell. They use carbon   cookstoves. They pay someone to let them charge their mobile phones. The term’s been floating around the global development space since 2011, when U. N.   Ban   made electricity access a global priority. It made headlines in February 2016 when U. S. lawmakers passed the historic Electrify Africa Act, promising to put 50 million Africans on the grid by 2020. Use it in a sentence: Some startups in Silicon Valley are fighting energy poverty by designing more affordable   lamps for people in the developing world.  A portmanteau of ”financial” and ”technology” used to describe emerging financial services like virtual currency, mobile banking and online payment systems. Last year, economists and developers started exploring how fintech might benefit the developing world. With just a mobile phone and an Internet connection, fintech makes it possible for people without bank accounts to save and send money  —   or get the loans they need to start a small business. Use it in a sentence: Thanks to fintech, a Nigerian worker in China can send money back to his family using his mobile phone.  Proof that you are a citizen in a country. Some 1. 5 billion people, mostly in Africa and Asia, are undocumented  —   limiting their ability to vote, get a job or inherit property. The need for NID has always been an important issue in global development, but over the past couple of years, there’s been growing momentum in Africa to ensure that all citizens have these important documents from birth. This April, countries will meet in Namibia for the third Government Forum on Electronic Identity in Africa, in the hopes of finding better ways to register citizens. Use it in a sentence: Sorry, madame, we cannot admit your    child to school unless she has NID. How ecosystems affect human health. In the face of climate change and rapid urbanization, it’s a topic that will continue to grow in the years ahead. Climate   droughts, for example, can cause crop shortages that lead to malnutrition. And cutting down forests to make way for housing can expose humans to harmful viruses that are carried by   animals. In December, The Lancet, a medical journal, created a new publication to help share research on the subject across the the global health community. Use it in a sentence: The dwindling bee population is a big planetary health issue  —   we need them to pollinate   crops that help humans stay healthy. A fancy acronym for drones and similar airborne robots. UAVs have been around awhile, but in the field of global health, the term got quite a lift in 2016. Aid groups are testing out UAVs to deliver everything from contraceptives to vaccines to the remotest parts. They’re even being used to help communities map flood risk by capturing aerial images of slums in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. Use it in a sentence: Dust is a big problem for the UAVs that deliver health care goods over desert terrain in Ghana  —   it makes it hard for the remote pilots to see where the drone is flying.

"A week after a gunman killed 39 people in an Istanbul nightclub, the suspected assailant remains at large and secular Turks are feeling under attack. ISIS claimed the shooting, calling it an assault on what it called ”a pagan holiday.” The government’s pledge to defend all lifestyles hasn’t kept an atmosphere of fear from descending on some of Istanbul’s secular neighborhoods. By way of contrast, some Turks point to what happened in November 2015, when gunmen stormed Paris cafes and entertainment venues, killing more than 100 people. Parisians quickly rallied, saying the only response was to keep right on going out at night, which many did. In Istanbul, there was a similar call right after the New Year’s nightclub attack, but the response so far has been different. A well known Turkish writer and actor, Gulse Birsel, wrote a newspaper column urging people not to get lost in despair. ”Go out every night,” she wrote, ”to a movie, a play, hang out at a music concert.” The column has drawn praise. But in Istanbul’s more secular neighborhoods the response feels more like fear than defiance. Empty Tables, Fearful Customers, ”Beer Time” is a bar that occupies a corner just off the city’s major commercial thoroughfare, Istiklal Street. Songs from the pop charts of yesteryear are playing as bartender Selami, who like many Turks these days is cautious around reporters and gives only his first name, sits down to chat. He only has a couple tables to watch. He says in the past several years business has gone from bad to worse. ”There were the Gezi Park protests in 2013,” he says, referring to   demonstrations in nearby Taksim Square that were violently crushed by riot police. Then there was a bomb that hit tourists on Istiklal Street  —   after that, he says the place was almost empty. ”This New Year’s Eve we were actually packed,” he says. ”But then people started getting alerts on their phones about the nightclub attack, and in no time pretty much the whole street was deserted.” Selami jumps up as a quartet of students gets ready to leave. These days, he says, it’s mainly students who come here. His old regulars are nowhere to be seen, and the customers that do show up are jittery. ”I think it was yesterday, a woman came in and ordered a beer,” he says. ”She saw two foreign guys at another table and called me over. She pointed at one and said, ’Doesn’t he look like the nightclub attacker?’ People are starting to feel  .” President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been trying to pull a divided country together, and says he won’t allow terrorists to harm anyone’s lifestyle, religious or secular. He told an audience of local leaders that he rose to power arguing for tolerance for pious Muslims in officially secular Turkey, and that same tolerance should extend to those with secular values. ”Just as it is wrong for people who cannot tolerate the call to prayer to trample on a preacher, it is wrong to use force against those who do not pray,” he said to warm applause. ”In Turkey, nobody’s life style is under systematic threat.” Secular Turks aren’t so sure about that. They’ve been feeling increasing pressure for years under Erdogan’s government, led by a party with roots in political Islam. Turkey’s head of religious affairs was one of the first to condemn the nightclub attack. Critics say that may be in part because the day before New Year’s Eve, he issued a sermon to be read in all mosques. It criticized   celebrations as not consistent with Muslim values. In the largely secular Cihangir neighborhood, home to Turks, foreign journalists and diplomats, a young man who gives his name as Aram take a break outside a   called Mellow. It looks like a cheerful shoebox of a place, but these days Aram says the mood is somber. Many of his Turkish customers are staying away, and too many of the expats who round out the cosmopolitan atmosphere here are dropping in to say goodbye. ”I remember one Italian guy who used to come here a lot,” he says. ”He’s lived here for 10 years, but he said he has to go home because he doesn’t feel safe here.” Another trend he’s noticed is people moving out of the neighborhood altogether.   Turks say secular values may be fiercely defended in Paris, but in today’s Turkey they’re merely tolerated, and then only sometimes. They’re hoping the president’s call for tolerance is more than just reassuring rhetoric."
"Dear Sugar Radio is a weekly podcast from member station WBUR. Hosts Steve Almond and Cheryl Strayed offer ”radical empathy” and advice on everything from relationships and parenthood to dealing with drug problems or anxiety. Today the Sugars hear from a woman going through radical physical  —   and emotional  —   changes. She was ”extremely overweight,” but lost 100 pounds. Now she wants to have a ”grand adventure” and feels that her husband is holding her back. If you lose weight, do other parts of your life inevitably change as well? To help answer this and other questions, they’re joined again by Lindy West, a writer, editor and performer whose work focuses on pop culture, social justice and body image. She’s the author of Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman. Dear Sugars, My husband and I got married four years ago. I was 28 and he was 31. It was the happiest day of our lives. We were excited for the future, happy in our relationship and ready to give marriage a go. We were also both extremely overweight. After marrying my husband, let’s call him Dylan, I began feeling motivated to make positive changes in my life. I changed my eating habits, started moving more, found a love for yoga and decided to become a yoga teacher. I lost 100 pounds. Dylan was supportive and encouraging the whole way through. He would cook me healthy dinners, celebrate my weekly weight losses (whether 1 pound or 5) and was my cheerleader throughout my year of yoga teacher training. He never left my side. He is the epitome of unconditional love. What they don’t tell you about weight loss is that after you lose a large amount of weight, an entire new world opens up for you. For the first time in 10 years, I am able to ride roller coasters. I can zip line, rock climb, kayak and paddle board without having to check weight restrictions first. I discovered hiking and found that nature makes me feel alive. I feel like a teenager again, Sugars. The world is mine for the taking, and I want to see it all. Dylan is ready to settle down. He wants to start a family. He wants to buy a house. He wants a garden and a yard for our dog. We will work at   jobs, come home to dinner every night and raise our children.  Those things sound lovely to me, but while they are what I wanted before, they are not even close to what I want now. I want to travel. I want to try new things. He’s willing to compromise with vacations and weekends of travel here and there, but I want more. I want a grand adventure. The ”next chapter” for us couldn’t look more different. I’ve changed so much while he’s stayed the same. I’m not even sure I want children anymore. So what now? I love this man, but I worry that if I’d been this person four years ago, I wouldn’t have gotten married. I feel like he is holding me back. I feel like I have a ball and chain. I feel selfish. I feel inspired. I feel like a jerk. I feel strong and confident and capable. I feel like I am ruining my marriage, like a terrible wife, but I feel amazing. I can’t imagine my life without Dylan, but at the same time, I don’t want to live with regrets. Signed, Lost in Love, Steve Almond: I’m not sure how much this has to do with weight. She seems like somebody who has gone through a radical shift in what she wants out of life. I’m not saying weight isn’t a relevant issue, but it seems much more fundamental that she wants to follow a different map. Cheryl Strayed: It’s really a fascinating dichotomy she’s set up. She sounds like somebody who allowed her body weight to make her world smaller than it should have been, and now she’s like, ”I want to have this gigantic life.” She’s so clear about this feeling of being held back. Subscribe to Dear Sugar Radio:RSSiTunesStitcher, Steve: Lost in Love, if you want to consider the possibility of remaining married to Dylan, then you have to talk with him. It sounds like the issues and differences in your priorities, and even what you inwardly feel toward him, are conflicting enough that you should be in counseling or individual therapy. I don’t think you’ve said to him, ”Sometimes I feel like you’re my ball and chain, and I just want to get away and have a big life, but you’re an anchor.” You’re not going to be successful in the marriage, or even moving out of the marriage, until you settle up and are honest with him. Cheryl: The final paragraph of this letter is fascinating. She says, ”I love this man, but I worry that if I’d been this person four years ago, I wouldn’t have gotten married.” This is interesting  —   the idea that you lose weight and then you’re a different person. Many years ago, I was a waitress and I worked with a woman who, over the course of the year that we were employed together, lost about 100 pounds. And it seemed like she was a different person. She went from being this kind of shy, reserved woman to suddenly showing up in these incredibly tight dresses and dancing on the tables. I remember watching this  —   not just a physical transformation, but the way she presented herself to the world. I ran into her years later, and she hadn’t gained back all of the weight, but she’d gained back enough of it. She was back to being that first person I met. Lost in Love, maybe this is a strange era where you feel like you’re out of the box that was both of your own making and that our culture defines for fat women. I think that you should be very careful as you make decisions based on this moment in your life. Lindy West: The way that our culture’s   narrative works is that weight loss is this magic ticket to a perfect life and all of your problems go away. If you read literature about people who’ve undergone really drastic weight loss, what you hear over and over is people saying, ”I discovered when I became thin that I had all the same emotional problems I had when I was fat. I had all the same   problems, all the same confidence problems.” It’s not magic. You still have to do all this work on yourself, emotionally and psychologically. It seems like she’s in this really electric moment, and it might be a good idea to take it slow and assess where she is and if she has realistic expectations about what being smaller is going to do for her life and for her problems more broadly.

"Dear Sugar Radio is a weekly podcast from member station WBUR. Hosts Steve Almond and Cheryl Strayed offer ”radical empathy” and advice on everything from relationships and parenthood to dealing with drug problems or anxiety. Today the Sugars have advice for people in different situations. In the first, a woman writes that she thinks her boyfriend loves her, but he hasn’t said it outright. She says she doesn’t want to say it first and make him feel forced. Is it possible to express your love for someone without explicitly saying it? Then they hear from a man wondering about the importance of physical attraction in a relationship, and thinking about how societal standards of beauty may be affecting his perception of his girlfriend. Dear Sugars, I’ve been dating a wonderful man for just over a year. We’ve been officially a couple for just about six months. We have so much fun when we’re together, and he shows me that he cares in so many ways  —   sneaking quietly into bed so he doesn’t wake me, inviting me to his family holidays, lots of kisses and snuggles when we’re together, and saying ”I miss you” lots when we’re apart. We spend all of our free time together, and we’ve decided to move in together in a few months. We talk about everything. He shares his ambitions, his insecurities, and whenever we have a disagreement, we talk it out. He is more open about his feelings than anyone I have ever dated. He’s told me that I’m the person he feels closest to. But there is one thing he hasn’t shared  —   his love. While I feel it from him, he hasn’t uttered those three little words to me  —   ”I love you.” Each time our relationship has moved to the next level, I have been the proactive one. But on this front, I have held back. I am waiting for him to tell me he loves me before I say it. I’d like to know he loves me before we take the next step of sharing a home together, but I don’t feel comfortable asking, ”Do you love me?” If he said yes, I would feel like I had forced it  —   like he said it because he knew it’s what I wanted to hear. So Sugars, what do I do? Can I get him to express his love in words without disbelieving it? How long is too long to wait to hear ”I love you”? Signed, I Love Him, Cheryl Strayed: I Love Him, welcome to a   relationship. There’s the way that you want the other person to be or behave, and then there’s the way that they are. You need to negotiate these things. To me, it sounds like your boyfriend loves you, and you love him. He just assigns a very different value to those three words. Maybe, for whatever reason, ”I love you” is just not a thing that he has said to people in his life. Steve Almond: That’s such an important point. I come from a family that did not say ”I love you,” and I had to train myself to say it to people. When others say it, I feel uncomfortable. It’s as if there’s been a sudden intrusion of intense direct emotion that makes me feel frozen. Now, I can say it because I know that it’s shorthand, I Love Him, for all the things your boyfriend does for you. I imagine that if you explain to him that it’s personally meaningful, even if it makes him feel a little uncomfortable, you’ll find out what his relationship to that phrase is and whether it’s something you should be unsettled by. Cheryl: The two options I see are either, go ahead and say ”I love you,” and you’ll just have to let go of this archaic, sexist notion that he should be the person who says it first. Or, you say, ”I need to talk to you about something. I love you, and I am perplexed that you haven’t said you love me. I’ve been waiting for you to say it, and I don’t know why it’s important to me that you say it first, but it is.” Maybe your view on this is rooted in the feeling that you are the proactive one and the one who compels emotional growth in your relationship at each juncture. That’s something really important for you two to unpack, and I think this ”I love you” conversation could be a great portal into that deeper relationship. Dear Sugars, I’ve been with my girlfriend for about a year now, and I’ve never felt such a strong connection to someone. She and I have more in common than I’ve ever shared with a partner, and our relationship has progressed very quickly.  Subscribe to Dear Sugar Radio:RSSiTunesStitcher, The only problem is, when we first met, I didn’t feel as much of a physical attraction to her as I thought I should, but I decided that my attraction to her on all other levels was deep enough to overcome that. I thought that our physical chemistry would grow in time, but unfortunately, it hasn’t.  I feel terrible and shallow for even writing this down, and I can’t imagine how I could ever explain this to her without hurting her deeply. I’ve even felt some of my male friends imply (or say outright) that they thought I could ”do better.”  My question for you is: Am I doing the right thing in pursuing a relationship with this wonderful person and ignoring what I perceive to be totally invented standards of beauty? Or is physical chemistry the first and most important part of a real relationship? Sincerely, Struggling with Standards, Cheryl: Struggling with Standards, I think that you are up against two things that you have conflated into one. There is your physical attraction to your girlfriend and the physical and sexual chemistry you have with her, and then there’s the invented standards of beauty. Those are two different things. The person that you are attracted to and have chemistry with is not necessarily someone who fits into standards and conventions of beauty. So the first thing to think about is, do you have a powerful physical bond with this woman, or are you hung up? Is the thing that’s inhibiting you from having this bond the idea of what women ”should” look like? And if that’s the case, the great news about that is that it can be revised. You can say, screw the standards. I love sleeping with her, I love this relationship. Now if, on the other hand, it is a chemistry issue rather than a beauty standards issue, I think that you’re right to ask this question. If you don’t have a basic, real attraction to your romantic partner, I think that you need to rethink the relationship and maybe break up or become friends. I will say, if you decide to end this relationship, I really don’t think that you should say to your girlfriend that it’s because she’s not physically attractive enough for you. That’s a subjective opinion, and it’s one that will hurt her for a long time and probably affect her for many relationships. Steve: The pattern in my life has been, when I get involved with somebody, as I find out more about who they are and all the hidden beautiful things within them, they become more attractive to me. What’s unsettling here is that, for whatever reason, after a year, she hasn’t become more attractive to you. Being steeped in this youth and   culture mixes up our internal lives. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could separate out how much is chemistry and how much is an external standard? The problem is, we’ve internalized these things, and they become false sacred texts inside us. That is something you should question yourself about. At the bottom of it, you cannot fake chemistry. A year isn’t a short amount of time to figure out whether the underlying chemistry is there. But if it’s not, it’s not. Don’t waste her time or yours trying to fake it, because that’s its own kind of humiliation. You can get more advice from the Sugars each week on Dear Sugar Radio from WBUR.

"When I told my coworker that I was participating in a study that involved fasting, she laughed until she nearly cried. My boyfriend, ever supportive, asked hesitantly, ”Are you sure you want to try this?” Note the use of ”try” instead of ”do.” When I told my father over the phone, the line went silent for a moment. Then he let out a long, ”Welllllll,” wished me luck, and chuckled. Turns out, luck might not be enough. I like to eat. Often and a lot. Now, however, my eating habits have become more than a source of amusement for friends and coworkers. Now they are data in a study focusing on people with multiple sclerosis, like me. The pilot study, led by Dr. Ellen Mowry at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, is looking at the impact of intermittent fasting on our microbiomes  —   the universe of trillions of microbes, mainly bacteria, that live in our guts. Intermittent fasting is pretty much what it sounds like. For six months, participants are allowed to eat during an   period each day. The remaining 16 hours we are limited to water, tea and coffee. No added sugar, cream, honey or sweetener. Several studies have suggested that the predominant bacteria in the guts of people with MS tend to be different than those in the guts of those without the chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease, according to Samantha Roman, the study’s research coordinator. Depending on their makeup, bacteria have the ability to soothe or trigger inflammation, potentially affecting the symptoms of MS and other diseases. Exactly how gut bacteria and inflammation are related, though, is not well understood. What researchers do know, Roman says, is that intermittent fasting is one of many ways to change the makeup of the microbiome, and it can quell the inflammatory symptoms of MS  —   at least in mice. To help shed light on the relationships between fasting and the microbiome and inflammation and multiple sclerosis in humans, researchers at Hopkins will inspect gut bacteria in study participants, before, during and after the   period of fasting. Two random mornings a week, Roman sends text messages, asking participants to photograph all of our food intake for the day. As a part of this study, I like to think that every bite I take may bring doctors one data point closer to easing the abdominal spasms that ebb and flow like a wave of knives, occasionally sending me to the emergency room. Every embarrassingly audible gurgle of hunger could be a signal that my microbial cohabitants are calming my immune system, muting the burning sensation that at times covers my skin from eyelids to  . Each   snack that I decline may help reduce the inflammation that has left my brain and spinal cord dotted with lesions that lead to those and other symptoms. It is a noble endeavor, I told myself as I prepared that first stool sample, and I have continued to remind myself of this lofty motivation every morning at 10 a. m. when inevitably, my stomach begins to growl. I’ll likely repeat the mantra at the end of the study, when I’ll need to prepare a second stool sample for comparison. Like so many such endeavors, this one isn’t easy. I took Roman up on her suggestion, and scheduled my periods of eating between noon and 8 p. m. I get home at about 7 p. m. several evenings a week after strength training, and there is no way I could go 16 hours without eating after the ordeal my trainer puts me through. I only started eating breakfast in the past few years. I figured I would slip back into that routine fairly easily. My first few days of fasting coincided with the presidential election and my car breaking down. These were   events. As it turned out, a little   helped out quite a bit. Thanks to the knot in my stomach, I had to force myself to eat. ”This is going to be a breeze,” I thought. Then came Saturday. After running several   errands  —   the butcher, the coffee shop, the grocery store  —   I was famished. So I did the sensible thing and bought a grilled cheese sandwich that was stuffed with crab dip. When I got home at about 2:30 p. m. I devoured it, then promptly fell asleep. I woke up two hours later in a panic  —   I only had a few hours left to eat! I wasn’t hungry, but just to play it safe, I ate a taco and some ice cream. In the first month and a half of the study, my symptoms have not changed much. I’m still fatigued, my hands and feet often feel as though they are on fire, and I have occasional muscle spasms in my feet. Still, things had been going well. I lost about 8 pounds (my regular diet includes more vegetables, less    grilled cheese) set a new PR at the gym, and slipped into a comfortable eating routine. Until my trip to Chicago. It was a wedding! What was I supposed to do? The answer, apparently, is drink. I did keep my food intake between noon and 8 p. m. But there was the snowy Christkindlmarket with its fragrant, sweet, hot mulled wine. And champagne toasts! And whiskey! Over three nights, I drank alcohol beyond my   limit three times. And then, in the most unexceptional place, for the most basic of foodstuffs, I hit rock bottom. After two hours of sleep, in Terminal E of O’Hare Airport at 7 a. m. I ate a bagel. I needed that bagel. I regret nothing. During that weekend, for the first time, Roman sent text messages two days in a row. Hesitantly, shamefully, I confessed to everything. The point of the texts is, after all, to determine how well participants stick to the program, as well as to have data to help determine if what we eat has any effect over and above when we eat. I have become the very reason I tend to   studies that rely on   data! I want to do better, for the opportunity to improve my health and for the integrity of the study. I’ll have to continue to remind myself of the nobility of this scientific endeavor, particularly in January, when I spend a week at the beach in Mexico.

"By many standards, Mireille Kamariza is at the top of the world. She’s a graduate student at one of the world’s top universities, working on her Ph. D. with one of the world’s top chemists. And she’s tackling a tough problem  —   tuberculosis  —   that sickens nearly 10 million people a year. Earlier this year,    Kamariza and her adviser unveiled a potential breakthrough in fighting TB: a way to detect the culprit bacteria faster and more accurately. But for Kamariza, the fight against TB is not just about scientific progress and prestige. It’s personal. Kamariza grew up in the small African country of Burundi, where many around her were stricken with TB. A close relative lived with the disease for years  —   and eventually died from it. It was common for people in her town to get sick with TB and ”wait to see if you’d die  —   and if you survived, you’d just kind of live with it.” A World Health Organization report released in October states that an estimated 10. 4 million people were infected with TB in 2015, up from previous years  —   and 1. 8 million died from the disease. TB is still a stigmatized disease in Burundi, so Kamariza doesn’t want to be specific about her relative’s identity. But, she says, he most likely didn’t get treated ”because he didn’t know you could be treated, and even if he did know, [treatment] was far from where he was  —   and expensive.” Kamariza’s journey hasn’t been easy. In Burundi, it’s rare for girls to attend college  —   not to mention work with   scientists. ”Science was something that Europeans and Americans did,” she says. ”It was for other people  —   not for me.” When she was in high school, she didn’t have a clue about science careers. Neither did her parents. ”I never dreamed [Kamariza] would become a scientist because it is a career path that is unknown in Burundi,” says Denise Sinankwa, Kamariza’s mother. Sinankwa had her hands full when Kamariza was young. She and her husband were raising four kids during a bloody civil war. Nearly 300, 000 civilians were killed. The family moved a lot, and Sinankwa often worked multiple jobs to feed the family. But Sinankwa still pushed Kamariza to do well in school. She wanted her daughter to land a   job and be able to support herself. Kamariza considers herself lucky. She attended a   Catholic school, where ”things were more rigorous” than other public schools. The ”nuns’ school” instilled a mindset most of her peers lacked because generally girls ”were raised to be a wife,” she says. Kamariza wanted to pursue studies in the U. S. where her   brother had already landed. So, when she was 17, Kamariza packed up her belongings and traveled with her third brother half way around the world. She went to San Diego in the fall of 2006 and moved into a tiny studio apartment with her brothers. The four worked various jobs at grocery stores, restaurants, retail shops  —   ”whatever we could get to pay the bills,” Kamariza says. Their earnings also paid for classes at a junior college. Then Kamariza’s hard work started to pay off. At San Diego Mesa College, she found a   mentor. Her chemistry teacher, Saloua Saidane, was a fellow   African. Born to illiterate parents in Tunisia, Saidane was one of 12 children and knew what it was like to be a poor immigrant kid pouring herself into school as the only way to a better future. ”Kamariza was serene yet determined,” Saidane says. ”She worked hard. She saw the opportunity to have a good life, a life different from what she left behind.” Saidane started Kamariza’s journey into science. ”She really pushed me and kept motivating me and telling me I should aim high. Whatever she told me, I did,” Kamariza says. After quitting her job at Safeway to focus on school, Kamariza got into the University of California, San Diego, and began undergraduate studies. Through a National Institutes of Health diversity scholarship, Kamariza spent summers doing biology research. In 2012, she joined Carolyn Bertozzi’s lab  —   then at the University of California, Berkeley, now at Stanford University  —   as a graduate student. Kamariza wanted to focus on infectious disease. So she started brainstorming with another graduate student to figure out a quicker, better way to diagnose TB. They eventually came up with a new test that recognizes a sugar, called trehalose, that is uniquely found in TB bacteria. In the presence of a special substance, TB bacteria cells glow green, making the microbes easy to spot on microscope slides of an infected person’s mucus or saliva. Current TB tests are laborious and not very sensitive  —   some infections are missed. TB cultures are more reliable but take six weeks to produce a result. Kamariza  —   and other researchers elsewhere  —   are creating methods that could make TB diagnoses simpler and more accurate. Kamariza’s method looked promising this year when she and her colleagues tested it on a small batch of samples from patients in South Africa. But the tools are still in the developmental phase. Larger, more rigorous studies are needed for the method to be considered for use in clinics. Though unfinished, the research drew heavy crowds when Kamariza presented her data on a poster at a TB conference in September in Paris. Considering her improbable journey  —   from a child witnessing the tragedy of this disease to a young researcher contributing toward its eradication  —   ”the whole experience is surreal,” Kamariza says. ”A lot of hard work, a bit of luck, perseverance and relentless support from friends and family are what got me here,” says Kamariza, She hopes her experience can ”encourage others like me to pursue their passions, no matter the obstacles.”"
"Donald Trump has named his    to a top White House job. Jared Kushner will serve as a senior adviser to the president, and the transition team says he will work with incoming Chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Stephen Bannon ”to execute   Trump’s agenda.” The announcement also says Kushner will not receive a salary while serving in the Trump administration, which could help alleviate legal problems stemming from federal   law. Kushner, a    real estate developer and publisher of the New York Observer, has been married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka since 2009. When it was reported last week that they would be moving to Washington, D. C. it fed into speculation that one or both would serve as advisers in the Trump administration. ”Jared has been a tremendous asset and trusted advisor throughout the campaign and transition and I am proud to have him in a key leadership role in my administration,” Trump said in a statement, nothing Kushner’s success in business and politics, with his role in the inner circle of the  ’s 2016 campaign. In the statement, Kushner said, ”It is an honor to serve our country. I am energized by the shared passion of the   and the American people and I am humbled by the opportunity to join this very talented team.” Bringing family members into the White House may prove difficult, though. That’s because of a 1967   law, inspired by another famous family, as NPR’s Jim Zarroli recently reported: ”The   law was passed by Congress in response to President John F. Kennedy’s decision to appoint his brother Robert as attorney general, says Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. ” ’It was very controversial at the time. Lyndon Johnson in particular did not like that, and when he became president he helped shepherd this   law through the U. S. Congress,’ West says.” But it’s not entirely clear what that law means. Here is what the statute lays out, as NPR’s Ailsa Chang reported in November: ”A public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official.” The question now is what exactly ”agency” means, Chang reported. This question has come up before  —   in a 1993 case pertaining to President Bill Clinton, who appointed wife Hillary to head up a health care reform task force. In that case (which was not in fact about nepotism at all) the judge mentioned in his decision that the statute didn’t seem to apply to White House staff. But that still isn’t settled law, Chang also reported. ”There’s plenty of disagreement in the legal community about whether that bit from Judge Silberman’s opinion is legally binding because it wasn’t part of the reasoning for the central holding in the case.” But the fact that Kushner will not draw a salary could be key. Government ethics lawyer Ken Gross pointed out to NPR last November that the statute requires violators give up compensation, which he described as an ineffective way to enforce the law. ”So it sounds like you could have someone in an unpaid position, and then they’ve already suffered the penalty for violating the provision, and presumably, they would go on their merry way as an unpaid member,” said Gross at the time. Even leaving aside the appointment’s legality, it could also raise plenty of ethical questions. In a recent piece, the New York Times laid out the many possibilities for conflicts of interest to arise with Kushner in the White House. For example, the Times reports that Kushner ”played a pivotal role in persuading” Trump to appoint Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn  —   whose bank lent money to the Kushner Cos.  —   as director of the National Economic Council. Kushner’s legal counsel, Jamie Gorelick  —   who served as deputy attorney general during Bill Clinton’s administration  —   told NPR’s Jackie Northam on Monday that Kushner plans to divest from his real estate holdings in anticipation of serving in public office. ”He is going to restructure his business, so that he will no longer have any active involvement in Kushner Co. entities, which are real estate entities mostly in New York. He will divest a substantial number of his assets, and for any of those that remain he will abide by all the appropriate recusal requirements of the ethical guidelines,” Gorelick said."
"On behalf of the U. S. State Department, John Kerry has issued a formal apology for the department’s pattern of discrimination against LGBT employees during a period beginning in the 1940s and stretching for decades. Sen. Ben Cardin,  . had asked the secretary of state for such an apology in late November, calling the historical discrimination ”  and unacceptable.” The Washington Blade reported on Cardin’s request in early December, noting at the time that the State Department said it was preparing a response. The mass purge of gay staffers during the   century was known as the ”Lavender Scare,” which coincided with the ”Red Scare.” Author Eric Berkowitz, speaking to Terry Gross on Fresh Air in 2015, said the systematic discrimination against gay people in that era has ”gotten short shrift in the popular imagination.” At the same time as the persecution of alleged communists, ”there was no less energetic a hunt to root out what were called ’perverts’ . .. from the federal government,” he said. And it started in the State Department, explains David Johnson, the author of The Lavender Scare. He says that in the ’40s, the State Department was already systematically firing gay employees. Then, in 1950, Joseph McCarthy claimed to have a list of communists in the State Department. In an attempt to defend itself against the charges, the department pointed out that it was working hard to expel ”subversives”  —   by firing gay people. That disclosure kicked off the wider ”Lavender Scare.” ”The purges begin in the State Department,” Johnson says. ”And then in the politicized atmosphere of McCarthyism, they doubled down.” In 1953, years after the State Department began firing gay employees, Dwight Eisenhower instituted a nationwide ban on gay men and lesbians working for the federal government. Purges lasted for decades. Careers were destroyed, and some employees committed suicide, Johnson says. Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, wrote to Kerry on Nov. 29 to ask that in his last months as secretary of state, he address that history. Cardin said that more than 1, 000 people were dismissed from the Department of State for their alleged sexual orientation, and ”many more” prevented from joining the department through discriminatory hiring practices. As recently as the 1990s, he said, the State Department drove out personnel thought to be gay, calling them ”security risks.” Cardin urged Kerry to acknowledge the discrimination, apologize for it  —   and perhaps install an exhibit about it at the State Department’s museum. ”Of course, the measures we take today cannot bring back years of anguish or erase decades of institutionalized homophobia, but we can ensure that such injustices levied against the LGBT community are never repeated again,” Cardin said in a statement in early December. Kerry responded with a statement released Monday. He began by highlighting the State Department’s recent support for LGBT and intersex employees. Then he wrote: ”In the past  —   as far back as the 1940s, but continuing for decades  —   the Department of State was among many public and private employers that discriminated against employees and job applicants on the basis of perceived sexual orientation, forcing some employees to resign or refusing to hire certain applicants in the first place. These actions were wrong then, just as they would be wrong today. ”On behalf of the Department, I apologize to those who were impacted by the practices of the past and reaffirm the Department’s steadfast commitment to diversity and inclusion for all our employees, including members of the LGBTI community.” Human Rights Campaign Government Affairs Director David Stacy said in a statement that ”although it is not possible to undo the damage that was done decades ago, Secretary Kerry’s apology sets the right tone for the State Department as it enters a new and uncertain time in our country under a new administration.” But David Johnson, a history professor at the University of South Florida and the author of The Lavender Scare, says that while the apology is welcome and overdue, Kerry’s statement misrepresents the State Department’s role in the purge. ”The apology made it sound like the State Department was just one of many institutions that was discriminating against gay men and lesbians . .. that it was just sort of     1950s   discrimination,” he says. ”In fact, the State Department was unique in its level of homophobia,” he says."
"Seven years ago, the Navajo tribal council in southeastern Utah started mapping the secret sites where medicine men and women forage for healing plants and Native people source wild foods. They wanted to make a case for protecting the landscape known as Bears Ears, a place sacred not only to their tribe but to many other tribes in the region, going back thousands of years. In one of his final acts in office, President Obama late last month created the 1. 35   Bears Ears National Monument, a move that proponents say will safeguard the area’s ecology and guarantee food sovereignty for the region’s Native Americans. ”Up to 20, 000 Natives of various tribes live within 45 minutes of Bears Ears, including 10, 000 Navajos that live just across the border in Arizona,” says Gavin Noyes, director of the Utah Diné Bikéyah, the Navajo nonprofit that developed the initial draft of the monument proposal in 2013. ”It’s one of the wildest, most intact landscapes in Utah.”  About 16, 000 people live in San Juan County, where Bears Ears is located. Roughly half are Navajo, and many in the tribe lack running water and electricity, says Noyes. But the land still provides. Women hike into the hills to gather wild onions and sumac berries for soup. They bundle juniper branches to burn, so they can stir the ashes into their family’s blue corn mush. And they forage for piñon nuts, which saved tribes from starvation during times of drought. Native hunters seek deer and rabbits, while elders collect sage leaves to throw over the fire in the sweat lodge, purifying the air and the thoughts of those inside. And when doctors fail to cure ailments, healers look to the sky for bird medicine in the prayerful flight of a   hawk or a golden eagle rising over   mesas. Under the Bears Ears Monument designation, an intertribal coalition will partner with the U. S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to manage the area  —   which is slightly bigger than the state of Delaware  —   ensuring that tribes have access to food supplies and firewood. Such a partnership has never been attempted before in the 48 contiguous states. For whites, conservation is a matter of not using the land, Noyes says. For Natives, it means actively tending it as they have for generations. ”Our goal is to change how Americans view landscapes so that they include cultures” as well as plants and animals, he says. But not everyone sees Bears Ears as a sacred source of food and healing  —   instead viewing the area for its   and mineral potential, or for ranching. The Democratic president’s most prominent critics  —   many of them Republican lawmakers at the state and federal levels  —   are already calling on fellow Republican Donald Trump to reverse the order after he takes office. That’s something no president has done in the   history of the Antiquities Act, the law that allows presidents to designate monuments. Especially in Utah, many of Obama’s opponents would like to see the area stay open to potential energy extraction. Bruce Adams is a cattle rancher and San Juan County commissioner. Last year, Adams said that while it’s important to look out for the rights of Natives, the white ”people who came to the area in the late 1800s” need to survive, too. And for them, that means raising livestock, but also extracting oil, gas, copper and uranium. ”Why should one group of people be given consideration over the rest of us?” he said. The state’s top politicians are just as disturbed at the news. Utah Rep. Rob Bishop says in a video, ”Utahns will use every tool at our disposal . .. whether it is judicial action, legislative action or even executive action” to repeal the Bears Ears decision. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes says his office is readying a lawsuit against the federal government. And Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent subpoenas to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and Christy Goldfuss, managing director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, demanding all documents related to the Bears Ears designation dating to 2013. But even some tribal members worry that greater federal presence under the new monument designation will make it harder for them to access wild resources. They’ve been failed by the U. S. government before and aren’t inclined to trust it this time around. ”As Native American[s] we understand what broken treaties and broken promises mean. We’ve lived it for the last 200 years,” said Rebecca Benally, a Native American and the first woman elected to the San Juan County Commission, at a news conference. Benally has opposed the monument proposal from the start, saying the federal government should focus instead on paving the county’s 700 miles of dirt roads and lowering unemployment. The anger in Utah is part of the larger discord over public lands in the West, where almost half of all land is federally owned. But in the case of Bears Ears, the battle lines feel especially deep because of the fissures between Native peoples and the descendants of Mormon settlers. In 2015, members of the Utah Diné Bikéyah formed the Bears Ears intertribal coalition with five other tribes to draw up a plan to safeguard 1. 9 million acres from energy extraction. The coalition sent its plan to the San Juan County Commission, but nothing happened. The tribes claim discrimination, citing the fact that a majority of the commissioners are white. But county leaders say race had nothing to with it. ”San Juan County is the   county in the country. To say we don’t want to even look for oil is stupid,” former San Juan County commissioner Phil Lyman said. Lyman served 10 days in jail last year and was put on probation from the commission after he led an ATV ride over a Native American archaeological site to protest the closure of Recapture Canyon by federal authorities who sought to protect the artifacts. Ultimately, the county commissioners rejected the tribal proposal. Instead they sent their own plan, which maintained land for energy extraction, to Bishop and Chaffetz, who at the time were drafting a master proposal for managing Utah’s controversial public lands. Both Bishop and Chaffetz are part of the chorus of voices in the West calling for the federal government to cede control of public land to the states. Bishop is chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee and his biggest campaign donors are from the oil and gas industry, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Beginning in 2013, Bishop and Chaffetz conducted more than 1, 200 stakeholder meetings with energy companies, ranchers and environmentalists. The intertribal council says it was intentionally excluded. Last year, when the two politicians revealed their Public Lands Initiative, the tribes argued that large swaths of land in the Bears Ears had been left out, leaving it vulnerable to energy companies. Environmentalists raged that the bill favored fossil fuels. By the time the Public Lands Initiative was released, the intertribal coalition, convinced that it had no other choice, had reached out to Obama on its own. The bill failed to get to a floor vote before Congress adjourned for the year. The White House, though, kept talking with the tribes, and they got what they wanted. So too did the 71 percent of people in Utah who said they supported protecting Bears Ears, according to one poll. The Bears Ears Monument will cover 1. 35 million acres, less than the 1. 9 million acres that the tribal coalition had requested. And the final plan didn’t entirely ignore the Public Lands Initiative. For instance, the monument boundaries exclude the Daneros uranium mine, which mine operators say they hope to expand soon. Mining within the monument will be prohibited, but ranchers can still graze there, according to a statement by the Department of the Interior. Adams told reporters that San Juan County will join the state in suing the federal government over Bears Ears. Meanwhile, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch says he is scheduling a meeting with Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, Trump’s pick for secretary of the interior, to discuss what can be done about Bears Ears. And while no president has ever undone a predecessor’s monument designation, it’s possible Trump could try to be the first, even though some experts doubt he could win the legal case. Even if he doesn’t try, Congress could cancel the monument. It has done so in the past, but only 11 times  —   and only once in the last 50 years.

"The week before Donald Trump takes the oath of office will set the stage for his entry into the Oval Office. Not only will at least nine of his Cabinet nominees begin their Senate confirmation hearings, but the   himself will face reporters at a   press conference, where he may address how he plans to separate his business interests from his presidency. On top of that, President Obama steps into the spotlight one last time, on Tuesday evening in Chicago, for a farewell address in which he’s likely to frame his legacy. In addition to the busy schedule, Trump has demonstrated in recent days his ability to upend what’s happening in Washington or move the financial markets with a tweet  —   whether he’s going off on intelligence agencies, deflecting claims against Russia, or taking aim at companies that could move the financial markets. Here’s a guide to what to watch for before Trump becomes the 45th president of the United States. All times are Eastern. Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions is first up in the confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet picks, beginning at 9:30 a. m. Typically, there’s a lot of deference shown toward sitting senators, and the Alabama senator is   on Capitol Hill. But there will still be questions at his Judiciary Committee hearing about allegations that he once used racist language when he was a U. S. Attorney. Those allegations sank his hopes of a federal judgeship 30 years ago when he failed to win a Senate confirmation vote. Sessions has denied those allegations. He’ll also likely be asked about how he would handle civil rights cases, which have renewed scrutiny given the increased tensions between the police and many   communities in recent years. And he could also be pressed on whether he would prosecute Trump’s former opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, over her time at the State Department and her use of a private email server. ”Lock her up!” became a frequent chant on the campaign trail, but Trump has since abandoned that line and even admitted it was simply a campaign tactic. Retired Gen. John Kelly will also begin his confirmation hearing to lead the Department of Homeland Security at 3:30 p. m. Kelly is one of Trump’s less controversial nominees, but he’ll still face questions about Trump’s vaunted border wall proposal and other plans to curtail illegal immigration. On top of those confirmation hearings, the Senate Intelligence Committee has called a hearing for 1 p. m. on Tuesday where the heads of the CIA, FBI, NSA and the director of national intelligence will testify on Russian cyberattacks. That evening at 9, Obama will give his farewell address from McCormick Place in Chicago, where he held his 2012   victory party. With a Trump administration threatening to repeal or roll back some of the president’s signature accomplishments, such as Obamacare and climate change regulations, it’s a chance for him to defend his two terms. And while Obama has shown deference to Trump, whom he criticized as unequivocally unqualified and dangerous during the campaign, during the transition, he could still leave some words of rebuke or warning for his successor. Four more confirmation hearings are slated for midweek, but it’s secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson who is the most controversial of the slate. Beginning at 9:15 a. m. the former Exxon Mobil CEO will testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he’ll be peppered with questions about his relationship with Russia and President Vladimir Putin. Plenty of tough questions are likely to come from the GOP side. Former Trump antagonists such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the 2016 primary candidate, along with fellow Republicans like Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, have raised plenty of questions about Tillerson’s qualifications. His business involvement in Russia has only been magnified in the wake of U. S. intelligence findings that Russia conspired to influence the election with hacks into emails of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman. Trump has been reluctant to accept those findings. Russia’s role into those cyberattacks will also come up at the confirmation hearing of Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo, Trump’s choice to lead the CIA. He’ll also face questions about Trump’s pointed criticisms of the intelligence community and reports that the   wants to scale back some agencies. Education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos won’t sail through a hearing either. Democrats don’t like her push for voucher programs and charter schools, and there’s plenty of questions about her financial disclosures and potential conflicts of interest, too. The least controversial nominee of the day  —   and perhaps of Trump’s entire proposed Cabinet  —   is likely to be Elaine Chao, Trump’s pick for transportation secretary. Not only has she been confirmed before, serving as labor secretary in the George W. Bush administration, but she’s also married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The Sessions hearing before the Judiciary Committee will also continue on Wednesday with outside witnesses, including the head of the NAACP and a former attorney general, scheduled to testify. All of those consequential confirmation hearings could be overshadowed by Trump’s press conference at 11 a. m. in New York City. The   eschewed traditional rules throughout his unlikely campaign, and that continued into the transition by not holding the typical   press conferences. Trump had finally slated a press conference on Dec. 15 to detail how he would deal with his business interests, but canceled just days before. If the press conference on Wednesday stands, it will have been 167 days since his last press conference in late July  —   during which he encouraged Russia to try and find Clinton’s missing State Department emails. Trump had often mocked Clinton for going months without holding a press conference, and now he has done the same thing. Instead, Trump has taken to Twitter to try to influence the news agenda for the day and get his message directly out to the public, all while blasting the media. On Wednesday, he’s sure to face questions about his businesses and conflicts of interests, his recent comments about Russia, his criticism of U. S intelligence, his Cabinet picks and more. Trump’s pick for defense secretary, James ”Mad Dog” Mattis, will be the main event near the end of the week at his confirmation hearing at 9:30 a. m. before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The retired Marine Corps general still has to get a waiver to even let him lead the department  —   current law bars former officers from serving as secretary until they’ve been retired seven years, and Mattis only left the military in 2013. Many Democrats like the waiver, saying it protects the ideal of a military under civilian control. It’s only been approved once before, for Gen. George Marshall. Mattis, however, is   by both parties, and his opposition to torture is seen as a mainstream influence on Trump. Ultimately, he’s likely to get the waiver and to be confirmed. Ben Carson, Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, will also have his confirmation hearing at 10 a. m. before the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. While the famed retired neurosurgeon is likable, the big complaint over Carson is that he has essentially no experience in issues with the department he’s being tapped to lead. A top aide to Carson, who also ran for the GOP presidential nomination before withdrawing and endorsing Trump, had even said Carson wasn’t interested in a Cabinet position because he didn’t think he was qualified to lead a federal department. Billionaire investor and turnaround specialist Wilbur Ross will have his confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation at 10 a. m. as well. Like Trump, he has taken positions against free trade and wants to renegotiate current deals."
"Darlene Hawes lost her health insurance about a year after her husband died in 2012. Hawes, 55, is from Charlotte, N. C. She ended up going without insurance for a few years, but in 2015 she bought coverage on HealthCare. gov, the Affordable Care Act marketplace, with the help of a big subsidy. ”I was born with heart trouble and I also had, in 2003,   surgery,” she says. ”I had   surgery. I have a lot of medical conditions, so I needed insurance badly.” After the results of the 2016 election came in, she was scared she’d lose her insurance immediately. For years, Republicans have vowed to scrap the health care law. The new Congress is already working on a plan to undo the Affordable Care Act. But they have not settled on how to replace the health care structure that Obamacare set up. Hawes is one of about 550, 000 North Carolinians who relies on the Obamacare marketplace for health insurance. She was relieved after she talked with an enrollment specialist last month who told her she can renew her policy for 2017. ”And I’m like, ’Oh my Lord, did she just say that?’ ” Hawes asks with a laugh. ”It’s just like a whole load of burdens just fell off of my back because all the years I haven’t been covered since my husband passed away  —   I don’t want to be sad again. I was very sad.” Most health care researchers and policy analysts agree not much is likely to change in 2017. ”Even the Republican Congress in one of their most recent bills to repeal it, they put in a   transition period, so that the premium subsidies and the other provisions of the law that are fundamental wouldn’t be repealed for a couple of years,” says Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University’s. Some Republican leaders say repeal should happen immediately with a transition period to come up with a replacement. Still, the CEO of HealthCare. gov, Kevin Counihan, says he can’t guarantee coverage will remain. ”It’s not my place to promise anything about a new administration,” he says. ”But what I can tell you is not only are we moving forward, but our enrollment is higher than expected.” At the end of 2016, enrollment for 2017 plans spiked and as of the end of December, North Carolina has the   enrollment for 2017 plans among states using HealthCare. gov. Julieanne Taylor with Legal Services of Southern Piedmont is helping people sign up. She says about a third of them have asked about the election. ”But generally when we’re calling, people are really excited to have their appointment and come in and look at the plans for 2017,” she says. ”I think they’re mostly interested in how much they’re going to be paying.” In some ways, North Carolina is in tough shape. Premiums are going up and insurance companies have dropped out, leaving Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina as the only insurer in 95 percent of the state. Blue Cross actuary Brian Tajlili says it’s simply an expensive market that has older, sicker people who cost more to cover. ”There is continuing demand for services and continuing high utilization within this block of business,” he says. What he calls ”this block of business” means the customers who buy insurance on the exchange. It’s a small slice of the overall health insurance market, because most people are covered through work or Medicare. The overwhelming majority of consumers who buy coverage on the exchange get federal subsidies that greatly reduce what they pay. Still, it’s been a turbulent market for consumers and insurers. Over the past two years, Blue Cross has lost $400 million in North Carolina on that part of its business. Amid the   uncertainty, Tajlili says Blue Cross is committed to offering plans in 2017. ”2017 will be another pivotal year for us as we look at the individual market,” he says. One of Blue Cross’ new customers will be Sara Kelly Jones, 46, who works at Letty’s restaurant in Charlotte, N. C. She recognizes Obamacare isn’t perfect. But before the law, health insurance was a financial vise that kept tightening on her. ”I could not afford it at all,” she says. ”Every year it was going up $100 to $120, $150 a month. It got to the point where it was going to be at least $200 more a month than my mortgage.” But under Obamacare, Jones qualifies for a subsidy. Her premium will go up with Blue Cross, but she says she can afford it with that help. Jones says the political debate over the law ignores people like her. ”I’m terrified,” she says. She’s worried about the Republican Congress’ pledge to scrap and replace Obamacare without presenting a detailed proposal. ”If there had been any plan outlined that wasn’t just some vague, ’We’re going to replace it with something awesome,’ ” she says she’d rest easier. ”They have no plan! What on Earth are you going to do with all these people, myself included, that are counting on this?” This story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, WFAE and Kaiser Health News.

"Two law enforcement officers have been killed during a massive manhunt for a murder suspect in Orlando, Fla. Master Sgt. Debra Clayton radioed from a   shortly after 7 a. m. Monday, saying she was ”attempting to contact a murder suspect,” according to a statement from the City of Orlando. Other officers radioed two minutes later, reporting that an officer had been shot. The   veteran of the department died after she was transported to a hospital. Police are seeking Markeith Loyd in the murder of a pregnant woman named Sade Dixon last month. Loyd fled from the   and pulled into a nearby apartment building, where police say he fired shots at a sheriff’s deputy but did not harm him. Loyd then allegedly stole a car and escaped. This put a manhunt into motion for the suspect, described as ”armed and extremely dangerous.” During the search, authorities say, a sheriff’s deputy riding a motorcycle was hit by a car and later died. The deputy has been identified as Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, an    of the force. ”This is probably one of the toughest days for me in my career,” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told reporters. ”Because not only did we lose an Orlando police officer today, we lost an Orange County deputy sheriff as well who was traveling on his motorcycle as a result of these broad efforts that we have underway.” Law enforcement is ”highly motivated to bring this suspect to justice,” the sheriff said. There is a reward of up to $60, 000 for information about the    Loyd. The Orlando Police Department says Clayton was married with a son. ”She was extremely committed to our youth and really, the community,” Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters. ”And she did so many different projects in the community. She organized several marches against violence by herself  —   that’s how committed she is.” The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted that Lewis was a ”gentle giant” with a ”million dollar smile.” In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said, ”These tragic deaths make clear the great risks that our brave men and women in uniform face each and every day, and the deep and abiding gratitude that our nation owes them for their service.”"
"The details of the story are unambiguously disturbing. Last week, a white    man from suburban Chicago was found walking in the cold, disoriented and bloodied. Four people, all black, had held him against his will for four hours, tied him up, and assaulted him while livestreaming part of it on Facebook. The young woman who recorded the video laughed and egged her friends on. One of the men took the knife that he waved in the victim’s face and cut off the man’s sleeves. One of his tormentors is seen on the video slapping him, and at one point, someone sliced at his hair and scalp with a knife, cutting him. His captors yelled ”F*** Donald Trump, nigga! F**** white people, boy!” According to the police, his attackers demanded a petty ransom ($300) from his mother. He finally escaped when several of his captors left to argue with a neighbor, and he was found by the police walking with one of the people in the video. Chicago’s superintendent of police described the victim as having ”mental health challenges.” His four tormentors, including one who was reportedly a school friend, now face kidnapping charges as well as condemnation from all corners. (President Obama told reporters that the incident in his adopted hometown was ”despicable. ”) But there was already a debate over how to characterize the kidnapping. Was it a hate crime? That’s not simply a legal question. In an earlier press conference, a police official demurred when asked whether this was a hate crime. He said the police had to determine whether the pronouncements in the video were ”sincere or just stupid ranting and raving.” That prompted angry backlash in some white circles, from those who felt that the case was being treated differently because the victim was white. ”If this had been done to an   by four whites, every liberal in the country would be outraged, and there’d be no question that it’s a hate crime,” Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, said on Fox News. The police did later file hate crime charges against the four suspects. ”There was never a question whether or not this incident qualified as being investigated as a hate crime,” police superintendent Eddie Johnson said. Under state law, both the victim’s race and his mental health  —   the police said he suffers from schizophrenia  —   were protected classes that made hate crime charges possible. ”It’s half a dozen of one, six of the other,” police Commander Kevin Duffin said. Whatever the reasons for the kidnapping, his captors cursed his whiteness. The legal specifics of the charges probably matter less than the message they send: Weren’t these kidnappers clearly racist? Didn’t they deserve the vilification that came with that description? In conversations about this case with friends and colleagues of color, I noticed that folks were straining mightily to avoid using the word racism, as if saying it might be an admission of something. I was squirming right along with them, and it took me awhile to figure out why. In some ways, this case being called a ”hate crime,” while a legal designation, might give people a rhetorical reprieve, as it allows us to talk about bias and violence without having to fight over the definition of racism. It reminded me of something Phillip Atiba Goff, who runs the Center for Policing Equity at John Jay College, told me a few weeks ago. ”One of the most important achievements of the Civil Rights Movement was to take the authority over moral character away from white men,” Goff told me. ”There’s no credential that [restores it]  —   having a black friend or relative is not sufficient.” Before then, white people were the only ones who could define what was righteous and correct  —   often at the expense of the rights and safety of black Americans. Goff said that the casting of racism as an evil worthy of condemnation made all the ways white people expressed their bigotry taboo. Those taboos are, in part, what people are referring to when they rail against political correctness. And while those new constraints certainly didn’t end racism, they suppressed behaviors that created space for people of color to live more fully in America. And that, to me, seems a big part of what we’re really discussing in stories like the one in Chicago, and what makes these conversations (and writing this) so discomfiting. In calling the kidnapping and assault racism, we’re staking claim to moral language  —   and uniquely powerful moral language  —   to which white people can’t easily lay claim, even in cases like the one in Chicago, which seems to qualify for the most vehement reproach available. And it’s why, I suspect, the folks of color I talked to seemed so visibly uncomfortable. Calling what happened in Chicago racism seems to cede at least some of that moral authority to the many people who we suspect are engaging in conversations about race and racism in bad faith people who want to push the conversation in the direction of a false, ahistorical equanimity. Is racism as expressed by centuries of white torture and discrimination the same as the racism of the four black people in Chicago? It’s a distasteful comparison. It’s as if you’re downplaying the misery of the young man in the video by reducing this conversation to semantics. But consider what’s already happening with folks from the   Internet, where people are holding up the Chicago case as the handiwork of black activist groups like Black Lives Matter (despite the complete lack of evidence that anyone involved in the kidnapping has ties to the organization). It seems that the people who have embraced this ridiculous claim  —   the hashtag #BLMkidnapping was used hundreds of thousands of times on Twitter  —   want to prove some kind of symmetry in American racism. One way to argue that the evil of racism is not uniquely wedded to whiteness is to argue that it is a moral failing that lives equally in blackness. It’s a notion that seems to be gaining traction even outside the fever swamps. Last year, two professors wrote in the Washington Post about their research showing that white Americans think   bias has been on the rise in recent decades, and that it now constitutes a bigger problem in the country than   bias. ”This perception is fascinating, as it stands in stark contrast to data on almost any outcome that has been assessed,” professors Samuel Sommers and Michael Norton wrote. ”From life expectancy to school discipline to mortgage rejection to police use of force, outcomes for white Americans tend to be  —   in the aggregate  —   better than outcomes for black Americans, often substantially so. (While a disturbing uptick in the mortality rate among   whites has received a great deal of recent media attention, it is worth noting that even after this increase, the rate remains considerably lower than that of blacks. )” It’s against the further legitimizing of this idea  —   that there are no distinctions to be made when we talk about racism  —   that I suspect folks are uncomfortably holding the rhetorical line, especially in this current political moment, rife with calls to validate white grievance. And it’s that sense of grievance that this video corroborates, regardless of whether it should regardless of how poorly it’s contextualized. Not that epistemology matters terribly much to the victim or his family. The video is chilling. It’s easy to go to an even darker place by imagining what might have happened to the victim had he not been able to escape. The captors wonder aloud about killing him. They are performing. They are talking back to their audience. One of the young women complains that there aren’t enough people watching. They livestream their torment of this man the way people might Snapchat themselves turning up at a club. It’s the kind of story that’s so random and unsettling that the desire for clear, moral parameters feels even more pressing. That’s why it’s worth wrestling over the language of racism, even if no words can make the event any more comprehensible, or, for the victim and his family, any less calamitous."
"In Venezuela, food has become so scarce it’s now being sold on the black market. One person tells the Associated Press, ”it’s a better business than drugs.” And the food traffickers are the very people sworn to protect Venezuela: the nation’s military. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro gave the military complete control of the food supply last summer, after people began protesting in the streets over food rationing. Shortages had become so bad that people were even ransacking grocers  —   though many were largely empty. These days, hunger remains widespread. But if you venture into the black markets, you’ll find foods that aren’t available in the   supermarkets, ”where people would prefer to shop because it’s a lot cheaper,” says Joshua Goodman, the AP’s news director for the Andes. He was part of the AP team that investigated the food trafficking situation. ”These goods are only getting into the country because the military is importing them,” Goodman tells NPR’s Audie Cornish. ”And when you see the food sold at these makeshift markets, there’s usually military people standing by with weapons, watching over it all, if not actually selling the food directly.” And the military isn’t just running these black markets  —   it’s getting rich off them, Goodman says. Goodman spoke with Cornish about the findings of the AP investigation. An edited transcript of their conversation follows. How does this affect the price of food? Right now there are some things that are incredibly cheap in Venezuela but in incredibly scarce supply. If you’re one of the lucky people to get the food at the   price, you are doing quite well. But a lot of people can’t afford to spend an entire day in line at a state supermarket, only to find the shelves have already been emptied by the time they get through the door. So a lot of people do have to go to the black market to find food. It’s a very unfortunate situation. Something like 80 percent of the country right now says they have lost weight because of what they sort of joke is the President Maduro diet  —   the forced austerity upon the country. You found lots of examples of how, essentially, the military is getting rich off controlling the food supply  —   even when people are trying to bring food into the country.  We documented a case of a South American businessman. He admitted to us that he had paid millions of dollars in bribes over the years to bring food into the country. And he really didn’t care who he was paying, because the prices [at which] he was able to sell to the government were so sky high  —   something like more than double the international price for a shipment of corn, for example. And that made it very easy for him to pay kickbacks to government officials. And of course, that worked its way all down the food chain. This businessman specifically pointed to the food minister right now, who’s a military general, or people close to him having received the money that he was paying. Now what’s happened to people trying to bring evidence of this corruption to the president? Venezuela right now is a very opaque place. We don’t have a lot of info about the internal deliberations of the government. There are some people in the military who clearly are upset with this situation. However, there are some serious entrenched interests within the military who are politically important to President Maduro. He is a man who is a hanging by a thread. . .. He does not have the popularity of his predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chavez. And the military for him has become an invaluable crutch in the face of mass street protests and sinking popularity and hyperinflation, almost. So this is a way to keep [the military] paid, frankly. Is that what’s going on? It’s a way to keep them fed, you could even argue. Because a lot of this food, I’m sure, is going to the families of the military, to feed their own families and friends. And yeah, it puts money in their pocket at a time when there really isn’t much money in the country. What has shocked you most about this situation? I think what has shocked me the most is the degree to which the military has really sullied its own reputation. They were seen by many as a disciplined force that could actually provide answers to the serious problems Venezuela is facing. Instead they seem to be much more   much more corrupt than I had imagined when we started this project. You’ve talked to a lot of officials in your story. For average Venezuelans  —   what are people saying about this?  They’re outraged. They know fully well that while they’re not eating, people are getting rich. This is an issue that touches the stomachs, literally, of every Venezuelan. A lot of Venezuelans who would be sympathetic to the government are very upset over this issue. And when they find out people are actually profiting from it  —   it’s a potentially explosive situation for the government."
"A powerful winter storm in California has brought down an ancient tree, carved into a living tunnel more than a century ago. The ”Pioneer Cabin Tree,” a sequoia in Calaveras Big Trees State Park, saw horses and cars pass through it over the years. More recently, only hikers were allowed to walk through the massive tree. Over the weekend, a powerful winter storm slammed into California and Nevada, prompting flooding and mudslides in some regions. The Associated Press reports it might be the biggest storm to hit the region in more than a decade. On Sunday, a volunteer at the state park reported that Pioneer Cabin had not survived. ”The storm was just too much for it,” the Calaveras Big Tree Association wrote on Facebook. It’s unclear exactly how old the tree was, but The Los Angeles Times reports that the trees in the state park are estimated to be more than 1, 000 years old. Sequoias can live for more than 3, 000 years. The iconic tree was one of just a few   sequoias in California. The most famous was the Wawona Tree, in Yosemite National Park it fell during a winter storm in 1969 at an estimated age of 2, 100 years. The other remaining sequoia tunnels are dead or consist of logs on their side, the Forest Service says. However, there are still three coastal redwoods (taller and more slender than sequoias) with tunnels cut through them. They’re all operated by private companies, the Forest Service says, and still allow cars to drive through  —   one appeared in a recent Geico ad. SFGate. com spoke to Jim Allday, the volunteer who reported Pioneer Cabin’s demise. He told the website that the tree ”shattered” when it hit the ground on Sunday afternoon, and that people had walked through it as recently as that morning. Local flooding might have been the reason the tree fell, SFGate reports: ” ’When I went out there [Sunday afternoon] the trail was literally a river, the trail is washed out,’ Allday said. ’I could see the tree on the ground, it looked like it was laying in a pond or lake with a river running through it.’ ” ”The tree had been among the most popular features of the state park since the late 1800s. The tunnel had graffiti dating to the 1800s, when visitors were encouraged to etch their names into the bark. ”Joan Allday, wife of Jim Allday and also a volunteer at the park, said the tree had been weakening and leaning severely to one side for several years. ” ’It was barely alive, there was one branch alive at the top,’ she said. ’But it was very brittle and starting to lift.’ ” Tunnel trees were created in the 19th century to promote parks and inspire tourism. But cutting a tunnel through a living sequoia, of course, damages the tree. ”Tunnel trees had their time and place in the early history of our national parks,” the National Park Service has written. ”But today sequoias which are standing healthy and whole are worth far more.”"
"From head to toe, a first lady’s look is heavily scrutinized, and Melania Trump will be no exception. But Trump is no stranger to the spotlight: In 2005, she was on the cover of Vogue in her Dior wedding dress, and she’s modeled for Harper’s Bazaar and posed nude for GQ. She also once sold her own line of costume jewelry and watches on QVC. With the whole world watching, the first lady can make a fashion statement like no one else. She can also make a difference during the campaign. In October 2008, just days before the election, Michelle Obama appeared on The Tonight Show wearing a mustard yellow sweater and printed silk shirt. When Jay Leno asked her what she was wearing, she told him her outfit was from J. Crew. The audience roared with excitement: ”We ladies, we know J. Crew,” Obama said knowingly. ”You can get some good stuff online.” Chicago boutique owner Ikram Goldman worked as Obama’s fashion consultant at the time. She says, ”The idea of her being inclusive was very important, and I think it was important to other people who were looking at her to feel like they can have access to that as well.” Obama also championed young American designers like Jason Wu, whose career took off after she wore his   white chiffon gown to President Obama’s 2009 inaugural balls. Goldman helped select the gown but kept it a secret until that night. She says when Wu saw it on TV, he called her. ”He was crying. He was shocked. He was happy. He couldn’t believe it,” Goldman remembers. Obama was embraced by the fashion industry, but Melania Trump comes from it. A former model, Trump seems to have a preference for European designers. She’s often seen wearing such luxury brands such as Gucci and Dolce  Gabbana, most of which she reportedly bought off the rack. ”Expensive” and ”body conscious” are among the first words Robin Givhan uses when asked to describe Trump’s style. Givhan, a Pulitzer   fashion critic for The Washington Post, says, ”It speaks to a bank account it speaks to a particular kind of social life and it speaks to a particular tribe of women who exist in New York, in particular. . .. They lead very comfortable lives. . .. They have both the time and the energy to attend to themselves.” Givhan says Trump’s look has ”a polish to it, a glamour to it, but not in a particularly personal or individual way.” Like Michelle Obama before her, Melania Trump’s choices are already making an impact. For her speech at the Republican National Convention this summer, Trump wore an ivory, cotton and silk dress with sleeves that billowed at the elbows. The $2, 195 dress (by   designer Roksanda Ilincic) reportedly sold out in the days following Trump’s speech. Meanwhile, retailers in Washington, D. C. are getting ready for a very different style of first lady. The ladies consignment shop Inga’s Once Is Not Enough is something of an institution in the nation’s capital, especially for women who need to dress for   formal events on a federal government salary. Sorting through the racks, owner Inga Guen says she would love to dress Melania Trump. She pulls out an olive green Oscar de la Renta dress,   with ivory beading, and a black cashmere jacket with a fur collar by Valentino. ”She would look très chic  —   très, très, très chic  —   in this,” Guen says. Guen describes Trump’s style as daring and slightly eccentric with a European sensibility. She says she’s already had three new clients come into her shop who’ve been hired by the new administration. ”I have no idea how they heard about me, but I dressed them and they were so, so very happy to have met Melania Trump,” she says. Asked whether their style was anything like Trump’s, Guen replies, ”Au contraire, it was not similar to her at all. But I said, ’We have to put a little bit of oomph in your wardrobe right now, we have to be a little bit glamourous.’ ” Guen hopes to do business with Trump, but the fashion industry is splitting at the seams over whether to work with her. Some designers have said absolutely not others say it would be an honor to dress any first lady."
"A police officer in Fort Worth, Texas, has been suspended for 10 days after an inquiry into his forceful arrest of a woman and her two daughters in December. The arrest was recorded and streamed live on Facebook, as The   reported at the time: ”The events unfolded in southwest Fort Worth, where Jacqueline Craig called police to say a man had grabbed and choked her    son after accusing him of littering. But after an officer responded to the call, the two engaged in a heated argument as bystanders, including Craig’s relatives, looked on. ”In the nearly   video that’s now been viewed some 2. 5 million times on Facebook, the responding officer is seen questioning Craig, as she says the man should have spoken to her about her son. The video was posted by Porsha Craver, Craig’s niece who used a smartphone to film a screen showing the original footage  —   and who offers her own comments about the police encounter.” Immediately after the incident, the officer in the video was ”placed on restricted duty status by the Chief of Police” pending the outcome of an Internal Affairs investigation, the Fort Worth Police Department said. The Fort Worth   reported that the officer, William Martin was ”contrite” and ”sorry” about the incident, according to police Chief Joel Fitzgerald, who called the suspension ”significant punishment” during a news conference Monday. The newspaper continued: ”Both Mayor Betsy Price and Fitzgerald said the situation was an isolated incident. He said various videos were reviewed during the investigation. ’We left no stone unturned,’ Fitzgerald said. ”The chief said the decision to suspended Martin for 10 days was his, and some members of the department’s command staff disagreed, [saying] he should have been more lenient. ” ’But the buck stops here,’ Fitzgerald said. He said Martin showed neglect of duty and discourtesy. He said the officer will undergo training before he returns to duty.” Craig told the Dallas Morning News she wanted the charges against her dropped. The newspaper reported that the charges include interference with public duty, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and failing to provide identification. The   says the charges have been forwarded to the district attorney, who will decide whether to prosecute."
"  projects like the musical film La La Land and FX’s TV comedy Atlanta won big at Sunday’s Golden Globe awards. But the most powerful moment of the night belonged to Meryl Streep, who used her acceptance speech for the honorary Cecil B. deMille Award of the 2017 Golden Globes, to deliver a harsh rebuke of   Donald Trump and to advocate for press freedom. Recalling the moment Trump mocked a disabled reporter from The New York Times during a campaign rally, Streep labeled it one performance in the past year that ”stunned” her. There was nothing good about it, but it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh, and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter. Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still can’t get it of out my head, because it wasn’t in a movie. It was real life. And this instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing. In what The New York Times described as a brief telephone interview early Monday morning, Trump said he had not watched Streep’s remarks. But Trump said he was not surprised he had been criticized by ”liberal movie people,” and dismissed Streep as a Hillary Clinton supporter. Trump also denied, as he frequently has, that he intended to mock Times reporter Serge Kovaleski for his disability, the incident to which Streep was apparently referring. Just a few hours later, Trump reiterated his remarks to the Times in a trio of tweets. Streep also urged the audience to support the Committee to Protect Journalists to preserve an independent press, and specifically outlined the wide and varied birthplaces of many Golden Globe nominees and winners. ”Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners,” she said. ”And if we kick ’em all out you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.” Streep wasn’t the only one to take on the   less than two weeks before his inauguration. Host Jimmy Fallon joked at the show’s start that the Golden Globes were ”one of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote.” While accepting the award for best supporting actor in a limited TV series, The Night Manager   Hugh Laurie joked it would be the last Golden Globes ceremony, because the awards are chosen by an association with the words ”Hollywood,” ”foreign” and ”press” in the title  —   groups Trump has criticized in the past. These barbs capped an evening in which the Hollywood Foreign Press Association championed the musical film La La Land, handing it a record seven awards, including best director for Damien Chazelle, best actor in a musical or comedy for Ryan Gosling and best actress in a musical or comedy for Emma Stone."
"Sunday night’s Golden Globes were, in the great tradition of the Golden Globes, full of unexpected winners and a certain fondness for Hollywood itself. In this case, that fondness manifested itself in part through a sweep of the   film awards for La La Land, which  —   in case you haven’t yet heard  —   is about dreamers. Elsewhere, Meryl Streep talked Trump, Donald Glover cleaned up, Tracee Ellis Ross had her moment, and awards shows continued to be the gift that may not keep on giving, but certainly keeps on going. It’s just the beginning of awards season, but we’ll be with you till the end. Meanwhile, we’ll have a full episode of Pop Culture Happy Hour this Friday, covering Hidden Figures and the new One Day At A Time."
"Tom Hiddleston is trending on Twitter, and not for a good reason. Last night at the Golden Globes, he won a best actor award for the AMC series The Night Manager. But his acceptance speech didn’t go over as well as his performance. Hiddleston recounted a visit he made to see medics from Doctors Without Borders in South Sudan. He was serving as a humanitarian spokesman for the United Nations Children’s Fund, and some of the medics ”wanted to say hello” because ”during the shelling the previous month they had   The Night Manager.” Hiddleston continued: ”The idea that I could . .. provide some relief and entertainment for people who work for UNICEF and Médecins Sans Frontières and the World Food Programme who are fixing the world in the places where it was broken made me immensely proud.” The internet showed no mercy. Sample tweets: Hiddleston is part of a long list of stars who’ve served as the celebrity face of a global goodwill organization. Today, the U. N. roster of celebrity advocates ranges from singer Selena Gomez to Indian cricket superstar Sachin Tendulkar. This generation’s most famous U. N. goodwill ambassador, Angelina Jolie, has dedicated a significant portion of her time to the UNHCR’s work with refugees. Other nonprofits have celebrity advocates as well. So let’s step back from the Hiddleston flap and take a look at this phenomenon. What makes an ideal celebrity spokesperson? Are there some who are better than others? And how do NGOs  —   nongovernmental organizations  —   go about picking them? The U. N. has a long history of integrating celebrities in its campaigns, dating back to stage and screen star Danny Kaye, who linked up with the   UNICEF agency in 1954. Many who work in the international aid community point to the 1980s as the ”tipping point” when celebrities and NGOs really forged bonds. That’s the view of Sam Worthington, chief executive officer of InterAction, an alliance of   NGOs (InterAction has worked with the U. N. in the past). Consider the 1985 Live Aid concert, which produced the song ”We Are the World” to aid victims of the Ethiopian famine. A who’s who of the music industry sang a song that sold 20 million copies, with proceeds going to famine victims. Picking a celebrity to front a cause isn’t just a matter of approaching a hot star. First and foremost, a celebrity must be ”likable” with a stellar character, says Nanette Braun, chief of communications at U. N. Women. And of course there can be a payoff for the celebrity. In a media environment where a celebrity’s every move is photographed and analyzed, charitable work can help shape someone’s image.   Worthington emphasizes that passion is central to a successful partnership between NGO and celebrity. A track record helps to indicate this. Anne Hathaway, he says, named as a U. N. goodwill ambassador last year, is a good example of a person who has been outspoken for girls and women’s rights: Hathaway has held previous posts advocating against child marriage with the Nike Foundation and was the narrator of Girl Rising, a 2013 CNN documentary that followed seven girls around the world as they sought an education and better lives for themselves. But a previously held public stance can only go so far in indicating a celebrity’s commitment, Worthington stressed. ”The issue is finding a celebrity for whom the cause actually means something and an individual who is able to advance the cause,” he says. Rajesh Mirchandani, the vice president of communications at the Center for Global Development, agrees. But there is a down side, he notes: Celebrities can be distracting because of their celebrity. ”If they [celebrities] are too famous, or infamous, the media is going to be more interested in their personal doings than the project they are supposed to be fronting,” he said. An ”unlikely but powerful” example of a celebrity who has been able to walk the tightrope between offering an organization   publicity and awareness while also acting as a strong role model is actress Angelina Jolie, says Mirchandani. Jolie began her work with the UNHCR as a goodwill ambassador in 2001 after adopting eldest son Maddox while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider in Cambodia and becoming interested in the local history of refugees. Jolie developed a focus on the needs of refugee women and emergency medical relief. In 2012, the U. N. offered her the rare distinction of ”special envoy,” recognizing her role in attracting attention to the refugee cause. But   matches don’t always work out. PETA, the animal rights group, once arranged for model Naomi Campbell to pose nude to promote its stance: ”We’d rather go naked than wear fur.” A few years later, Campbell was promoting fur for Dennis Basso. Then there’s the clueless celebrity. In 2013 a Telegraph reporter accompanying Downton Abbey star Elizabeth McGovern on a goodwill trip to Sierra Leone with the group World Vision wrote this: ”I ask about her new role as charity ambassador. She says that she has never been to Africa, and does not know what to expect. As if to prove this point, when we refuel in Dakar, Senegal, she gets mixed up and says we have stopped in Darfur, a region in western Sudan, some 4, 000 miles away.” Other celebrities are praised for their involvement. U2 singer Bono is cited by industry analysts as a model celebrity in his efforts to bring attention to poverty and disease in Africa. The ONE Campaign has been lauded by groups like the U. S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations for helping pass the Electrify Africa Act of 2016, which would help bring electricity to 50 million Africans by 2020, and GAVI for helping to secure funding for vaccines. ”He really changed the way we think of celebrities and charities,” Worthington of InterAction remarks. Emma Watson, who sparkled in Hollywood with her turn as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter franchise, has since marked herself as a vocal feminist with her #heforshe gender equality campaign after she was appointed a goodwill ambassador for U. N. Women in 2014. A video of her speech promoting the cause went viral and boosted not only Watson’s profile as an actress with a conscience but also the profile of U. N. Women. Indeed, celebrities have been the backbone of many fundraising and publicity efforts. The U. N. even has an office dedicated to brokering partnerships. But once the celebrity is chosen to represent their cause, it’s really up to him or her what to do with it. Commitments can vary, and there is no ruling authority that watches what a celebrity does. And there is always the danger of the Hiddleston backlash. ”In the best cases, the most enlightened celebrities understand that their fame and wealth is not the objective, but the platform from which to make a real difference in the world,” says Mirchandani, ruefully adding, ”If only they all did.” After Hiddleston’s remarks last night, it seemed that no one was talking about the work of Doctors Without Borders in South Sudan. They were just talking about . .. Tom Hiddleston."
"Beijing is launching a new police force aimed at tackling its persistent smog problem. This comes after a month of particularly severe air quality that left the capital and dozens of other Chinese cities blanketed in thick, brown smog. The city’s acting mayor, Cai Qi, announced over the weekend that the new environmental police force will crack down on polluters such as ”  barbeques, garbage incineration, biomass burning, [and] dust from roads,” according to the   Xinhua news agency. He didn’t offer any more specifics about the squad. Cai also announced other measures to tackle the persistent problem, including closing the city’s only   plant. In 2017, ”coal consumption will be cut by 30 percent to less than 7 million tonnes” and ”another 300, 000   old vehicles will be phased out,” the news agency reports. Cai said the city also plans to shutter 500 factories and upgrade 2, 560 others, according to the news agency. ”I totally understand the public’s concerns and complaints over air pollution,” Cai said, admitting that he checks the air quality index ”first thing in the morning.” China’s environmental problems are exacerbated by difficulties enforcing regulations. ”China’s ministry of the environment said during last week’s hazardous smog, inspection teams found factories resuming production, despite being given   orders,” NPR’s Rob Schmitz reports from Beijing. Rob explains the main drivers of China’s air pollution: ”China’s air pollution is mainly caused by   power plants and inefficient vehicles. While the government tries to answer public calls to address the issue, it’s also addressing the challenge of an economic slowdown and maintaining growth.” The environment minister, Chen Jining, said in a statement that he personally ”felt guilty” and ”wanted to reproach himself” about the smog. He added that it made people feel anxious. Last week, China issued its   red alert for fog in some northern and eastern regions, according to a ministry statement. As The   reported, some 72 cities were under pollution alerts. The pollution has deadly consequences  —   as we reported, the World Health Organization said 1, 032, 833 deaths in China in 2012 were attributable to air quality. That’s the highest in the world."
"In Georgia, lawmakers are set to pass a more than $20 billion budget this year and grapple with a failing hospital system. But Georgia, like many other states, faces a serious human resource problem in its Legislature: Salaries are often low and many   politicians can’t afford to be lawmakers. Former Georgia state Rep. LaDawn Jones loved serving in the General Assembly even as she juggled raising two kids and running a law practice. But she left after one term because the job didn’t pay enough. ”I absolutely believe that we need to increase the wage for legislators to keep up with the times,” said Jones. Lawmakers in Georgia make $17, 342 a year, plus a per diem for lodging and meals when the Legislature is in session and reimbursement for mileage. Serving in the Georgia Legislature is considered a   job, but it took much more of Jones’ time than that and she had to hire extra help for her law firm. ”If I really sat down and did the math I’m certain that the amount that I paid out was equal or more than what I received,” she said. Most state lawmakers don’t make much, While a few big states have   legislatures with higher pay (California pays lawmakers $100, 113 a year and Pennsylvania pays $85, 339) but in most states, legislators are paid like it’s a   job. According to data compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures, 30 states pay $30, 000 a year or less to legislators. New Mexico doesn’t pay lawmakers at all, while those in New Hampshire make just $200 per   term. Median household income in the United States was $55, 775 in 2015, according to the Census Bureau. ”Not paying legislators is like a very   pound foolish thing,” given the size of state budgets and complexity of issues that legislatures tackle every year, said Stanford University political scientist Neil Malhotra. That low level of pay also keeps many people from entering politics, said Malhotra. ”There’s very, very few working class people in legislatures. This might have something to do with why a lot of legislation does not seem very friendly towards working class people.” Even those with   jobs can find it hard to take several months off a year to work in a state capitol. Mike Dudgeon, chief technical officer at the video game company   Studios, is retiring from the Georgia General Assembly after six years as a state representative because he struggled to balance his professional and political commitments. ”Some people suggested that I sort of do the     and keep my seat in the Legislature and just do the bare minimum, just go down and vote and kind of do that,” said Dudgeon. ”But I just can’t do that, it’s not my personality. If I’m going to do anything I’m going to do it well.” No raise in sight, In Georgia, there’s no sign lawmakers will get a raise anytime soon. ”I’m not in favor of increasing legislative pay,” said David Shafer, a leader in the Georgia Senate. ”I don’t know that anyone serves in the General Assembly because of the pay, and I don’t know that we would attract a better legislator if the pay were higher.” That’s a perspective shared by lawmakers around the country, said Malhotra, because it doesn’t look good for politicians to vote to give themselves raises. ”People don’t want to pay politicians more money because they don’t like politicians very much,” he said. Both retiring lawmakers Dudgeon and Jones worry a big raise could spawn more career politicians. They like the idea of ”citizen legislators” who take time off from their jobs to meet at the state capitol for a few months out of the year, if they can afford it. While compensation for state lawmakers is relatively low, some draw salaries in fields closely related to their work in the Legislature, such as public relations and law. Others make up for years of low pay once they retire by quickly jumping to consulting and lobbying firms where compensation is much higher. As the new legislative session opens in Georgia, Jones wishes she could be in the mix. But Jones felt she ”could not dare ask my family to continue to make such a big sacrifice.” Instead, Jones plans to focus her political passions closer to home on local issues that she can afford to work on."
"Mothers should feel comfortable   infants in public, Pope Francis said on Sunday, even if they are in one of the most sacred spaces in Catholicism. Speaking at an annual ceremony to commemorate the baptism of Jesus, the pope addressed the families of 28 infants who were to be baptized in the Sistine Chapel. Some of the babies began to wail as the ceremony wore on, according to Vatican Radio: ”As the sounds of crying grew louder, the Pope joked that the concert had begun. The babies are crying, he said, because they are in an unfamiliar place, or because they had to get up early, or sometimes simply because they hear another child crying. Jesus did just the same, Pope Francis said, adding that he liked to think of Our Lord’s first sermon as his crying in the stable. ”And if your children are crying because they are hungry, the Pope told the mothers present, then go ahead and feed them, just as Mary breastfed Jesus.” This is not the first time the leader of the Catholic Church has expressed support for women who are  . As The Washington Post reported: ”During the same baptismal ceremony two years ago  —   in which he baptized 33 infants in the Sistine Chapel  —   he urged mothers to feel free to   their children if they cried or were hungry. The written text of his homily during that ceremony included the phrase ’give them milk,’ but he changed it to use the Italian term ’allattateli, which means ’  them.’ ” ”You mothers give your children milk and even now, if they cry because they are hungry,   them, don’t worry,” the pope said. Although the pope has repeatedly justified his position in the most traditional terms possible  —   harking back to the infancy of Christ himself, the stance on   does challenge norms in some churches. In 2014, the National Catholic Reporter published an article describing a mother who said she was told   during church was ”inappropriate.” In a 2012 Christianity Today article titled ”  in the Back Pew,” writer Rachel Marie Stone recalled, ”On a family trip to St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City, as I started to   my son in the sanctuary, I was whisked away by a security guard to the bathroom. ”Countless other Christian women, trying to feed their children without having to miss a sermon, have faced the disapproval of others who think breasts have no place in the sanctuary,” she continued."
"In South Korea, preparing for the worst has become a routine part of life. Twice a year, the country runs air raid drills in case of an attack by North Korea. Citywide sirens go off at 3 p. m. in the capital, Seoul. They’re supposed to bring the bustling city to a temporary halt. ”It’s a simulation of what will happen at a time of war,” says Jeong   a spokesman for Seoul’s Yongsan district. South Korea is still stuck in a technical state of war with North Korea, and has been since the North invaded in 1950. With Pyongyang’s ever more frequent missile launches and nuclear tests, Seoul  —   with a population of 10 million near the border  —   says it’s got to be ready. ”These drills are something every South Korean knows,” Jeong says. Drivers are expected to slow down and pull over  —   and most of them do. Pedestrians are expected to take cover. But it’s not clear that everyone outside knows they’re supposed to pretend an air attack is coming. On the day we witnessed a drill in late August 2016, there was a look of confusion among some folks on the streets when the sirens went off. Inside, government workers do know the drill. They have to, since they are the only ones required to take part in these each time. At the Yongsan district office, the lights go out at the   where people pay their taxes. Bureaucrats file downstairs to the lowest level of the underground parking garage. ”I think it will be over soon. Like about 10 minutes, 15 minutes,” says Will Park, who is interning at the district office. He grew up in the U. S. so this is his first air raid drill ever. We’re huddled with his   in the dark. ”I’m just following the directions . .. just moving with the flow,” Park says. And just as quickly as it started, the drill is over. The 300 or so employees of this district office take the stairs or the elevators and get back to work. So is this kind of drill really necessary? ”If we keep doing these drills, if war does happen, people will be able to deal with it without being too shocked,” says Jeong, the district office spokesman. The North Korean border is just a   drive from Seoul. Kim Jong Un ordered more than 20 missile tests last year alone. And since he has been in power, he has presided over three nuclear tests  —   two of them in 2016. ”In the event war breaks out, we can minimize the damage to human lives through repetitive practice,” says Jeong. That’s what preparedness is about: repetitive practice for a situation no one wants to see. Haeryun Kang contributed to this story."
"David Bowie had long wanted to make a record with a jazz band, and on Jan. 8 of last year, he realized his dream with the release of Blackstar. Two days later, he was gone. Donny McCaslin’s band helped him make that record, and now, a year later, we pay tribute to Bowie and Blackstar  by bringing McCaslin’s band to the Tiny Desk. It’s been exciting to see jazz find its way into the broader music world in recent years think Kendrick Lamar and   in general. Musicians such as McCaslin often play in their own small circuit, but have much to offer popular music. As a bandleader and sax player, he’s put out a dozen albums, the most recent of which is Beyond Now, with musicians Tim Lefebvre on bass, drummer Mark Guiliana and keyboardist Jason Lindner. Beyond Now was recorded after Blackstar, features a few Bowie covers and stretches the band’s own usual boundaries. For this Tiny Desk concert, you can hear an extraordinary group playing extraordinary music  —   including an instrumental version of ”Lazarus,” from Blackstar. Just as Bowie brought these musicians into his   world, I hope this set takes you down McCaslin’s jazz path. Beyond Now is available now.

"Chances are your doctor has stopped taking notes with pen and paper and moved to computer records. That is supposed to help coordinate your care. Increasingly, researchers are also exploring these computerized records for medical studies and gleaning facts that help individual patients get better care. Computerized medical records are hardly new. Pioneers at one of the nation’s first HMOs, Kaiser Permanente, were using electronic medical records as far back as the 1970s and saw them as a big part of the future of medicine. ”The part of it that they didn’t envision that we’re envisioning now, is how proactive a role patients would be taking,” says Dr. Tracy Lieu, who heads Kaiser’s research division in Oakland, Calif. Medical records don’t simply store facts about an individual’s health. There’s a big potential for a database of medical records to be mined to help shape an individual’s treatment. ”Patients are always saying, don’t just give me the averages, tell me what happened to others who look like me and made the same treatment decisions I did,” Lieu says. ”And tell me not only did they live or die, but tell me what their quality of life was about.” Kaiser hasn’t put this concept into action, but it’s working toward it. Lieu has a prototype of how it could work. She scoots up to a keyboard in her office and types in ”pancreatic cancer.” That search function pulls up data from Kaiser’s long history of treating this disease. She can narrow that search by cancer type, stage, patient’s age and treatment options, to look at trends and outcomes. The records also include information about patients’ feelings and emotional states based on a   survey that patients routinely fill out. (Individuals are not identified in the database.) That provides a hint about how a person felt before, during and after cancer treatment. But it’s not as complete a picture as patients might want as they weigh their options about treatment choices. Unfortunately, getting that level of detail could be a challenge, because it requires much more data than doctors currently collect. ”If you’re a patient and someone says, ’Gee, we’d like you to fill out this   survey on a routine basis,’ you’re going to say ’Why?’ ” she says. ”’What will this get me? How will this help my care?’ ” Yet that information could be incredibly useful to other patients contemplating treatment decisions. Another piece missing from the Kaiser records is genetic information about patients. Here, the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania is making strides. It has sunk a lot of money and effort into adding gene scans to electronic medical records. It already has scans for 50, 000 patients in its system. Dr. David Ledbetter, the chief scientific officer, says that number is growing fast, toward a goal of more than 125, 000 patients  ” and beyond. ”Even though this is primarily a research project, we’re identifying genomic variants that are actually important to people’s health and health care today,” Ledbetter says. Geisinger patient Jody Christ volunteered to get the genetic screen during one of her routine medical visits. Her doctor had been concerned about her high cholesterol and told her to work on getting in shape. ”So I started to ride a bike and 10 minutes in, I would start to get a sensation down my left arm,” she says. That made the    from Elysburg, Pa. uneasy, so she stopped exercising. But last February she got a call from the program that had run the genetic testing. They told her she had inherited a genetic trait called familial hypercholesterolemia, and that was why she had persistently high cholesterol levels. The disorder makes the body unable to remove cholesterol from the blood, making patients more vulnerable to narrowing of the arteries at an early age. That genetic diagnosis led to a series of clinical tests through the spring. Toward the end of April, Christ took a stress test, which suggested serious heart trouble. A few days later, her heart vessels were scanned in the cardiac catheterization lab, ”and by May 5th I was having triple bypass surgery.” She feels much better today and is grateful that she had volunteered for the genetic test that revealed this serious problem. ”I feel they saved my life,” Christ says. Genetic testing like this (known as exome sequencing) is not routine because the tests typically cost a few thousand dollars. But Ledbetter says the prices are falling fast, and this year could even be in the $300 range. ”So we think as the cost comes down it will be possible to sequence all the genes of individual patients, store that information in the electronic medical record, and it will guide and individualize and optimize patient care,” he says. Doctors don’t know how to interpret most of the genetic results. But there are a few genetic variations, like Christ’s cholesterol marker, that are clear indications of serious health problems. Ledbetter said    variants like that have shown up in 3. 5 percent of the patients they studied recently. That means the test doesn’t provide actionable information for the vast majority of the people who get it. But ”that 3. 5 percent is going to grow,” Ledbetter says, as scientists learn to identify more genes that are associated with disease, and scientists identify more of those genes in their population. ”I don’t know what the final number will be, but it will be in the 5 to 10 percent range.” The hope, he says, is that it will help reveal the biology of more common forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease, and possibly more complex diseases like obesity and diabetes. Geisinger’s experiment, done in partnership with a company called Regeneron, which funds and performs the gene scans, is an important foray into the new world where genetic data merge with electronic medical records. ”The scientific community has been waiting to see what would happen here,” says Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a professor of medicine at Yale University who researches cardiology and health care. He’s excited at the prospect of being able to look at physical symptoms in medical records and then look for genetic variations that could be responsible, but he says that the system is so far not at all robust. ”The quality of data [collected in medical records] is not necessarily research quality,” Krumholz says. Think of something as basic as the language in these medical records. The word ”shock” in a medical record could mean different things to different people. ”So I think it would be unfortunate if people felt that all of a sudden we had this remarkable treasure trove. There’s a long way to go to move from where we are now to where we need to be,” he says. The federal government is planning to recruit a million volunteers to expand this approach to research in its Precision Medicine Initiative, which has been rebranded as the ”All of Us” research program. The Department of Veterans Affairs started a similar effort in 2012. Scientists there have gathered a huge amount of data, which they are now starting to explore. But medicine is not yet at home in the world of big data, Krumholz says. ”Medicine’s got to catch up, and medicine’s got to understand how best to take advantage of all the information that’s been generated every day,” he says.

"French police have reportedly arrested more than a dozen people during raids linked to the   robbery of reality TV star Kim Kardashian West in Paris last October. During the robbery, a group of thieves burst into the private residence where Kardashian West was staying, held her at gunpoint, then escaped on bicycles with jewelry worth about $10 million. There’s some confusion about exactly how many people police have arrested  —   some French media outlets say 16, while others say 17. DNA left at the scene proved crucial to the investigation, one police official told Agence  . ”One of the DNA samples matched an individual known to police for robbery and criminal offences, who is considered a major thug,” the official told the news agency. He added that they were able to then ”build up a picture of the criminal network behind the robbery . .. adding that it stretched to Belgium.” Police arrested people during raids in Paris and in southern France, Agnes   a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor’s office, told The New York Times. She added that ”the oldest of those arrested was 72 and that several of the others were in their 40s, 50s and 60s, which suggested that they were part of an ’experienced” group,’” according to the newspaper. The police targeted those suspected of carrying out the robbery, along with intermediaries and those thought to be responsible for selling the stolen items, Le Figaro reports. Immediately after the robbery, a spokeswoman for Kardashian West said she was ”badly shaken but physically unharmed,” as The   noted at the time. Since then, she has kept a relatively low profile, but she tearfully recalled the ordeal in a promo video released Friday for her family’s reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians. ”They’re going to shoot me in the back,” she recalled thinking as she was surrounded by her family members. ”There’s no way out. . .. It makes me so upset to think about it.”"
