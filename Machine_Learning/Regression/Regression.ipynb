    "- In simple linear regression, wepredict the value of one variable Y based on another variable X.\n",
    "- X is called teh independent variable and Y is callled the dependant variable.\n",
    "- Why simple? Because it examines relationship between two variables only.\n",
    "- Why linear? when the independent variable increases (or deceases), the dependent variable increases(or decreases) in a linear fashion.\n",

    "- Least square fitting is a way to find the best fit curve or line for a set of points.\n",
    "- The sum of the squares of the offsets(residuals) are used to estimate the best fit curve or line.\n",
    "- Least squares method is used to obtain the coefficients m and b."
